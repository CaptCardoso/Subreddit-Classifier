Random Clone Wars Thoughts,The series makes me appreciate Anakin so much more- he’s much more likable in the animated show. I really like Anakin’s relationship with Ahsoka. I’m only on the second season; does his character get all angsty?  I’m mean he doesn’t seem like the same dude that slaughtered a bunch of sand people during the second movie.,1646328915,starwars,-0.5574

The idea that At least the prequels tell a coherent story is an illusion,"The prequels tell a story with a known ending.  That is what gives them this illusion of a coherency.  

,...but when you look closer;

The force is suddenly ""out of balance"".  What do they mean by this?  This is never explained, nor how this ""chosen one"" will bring it back into balance?

The Jedi's ability to use the force is suddenly diminished?  How?  Why?  This is never explained.

In the beginning of AOTC the Jedi stand up for Duku's character when he's accused of being behind the plot to assassinate Padme.  However, when Duku tells them that Palps is a Sith they completely blow him off (even though they themselves are suspicious of Palps).

Suddenly its, ""Lies and deceit are Duku's ways"",...but let's go ahead and use the army he obviously created (against him) without question?

Then there's Mace who says in one moment, ""The dark side surrounds the Chancellor"" then a moment later (when Anakin tells him Palps is a Sith) he acts surprised!?   

Of course there's Anakin's motivation and turn.  Its pretty clear that Anakin's motivation for turning dark is to save his wife from his ""bad dreams"" where she dies in childbirth.  This is evident in his very words at the moment of his turn, ""Just help me save Padme, I can't live without her!""

Unfortunately, Palp's first words here are, ""To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but together I'm certain we can discover the secret""

So, Palps just now admits that he doesn't actually know how to save Padme (despite maybe an hour ago, begging Anakin to ""use my knowledge"",..the knowledge to save Padme"").  Yet Anakin still joins him?

Now I've heard countless head canon explanations for all this, but if you have to use head canon to explain a movie, then its clearly NOT a ""logical and consistent"" i.e. ""coherent"" story!",1646325692,starwars,0.0

About Luke Skywalker,"If Disney HAS to bring him back constantly now, at least do something with him instead of doing Empire but in reverse. I feel like making the essential Star Wars main character just cameo fodder and/or punching down on him because he apparently makes the very same mistakes as every Jedi before him having learned nothing from the past is just gonna make people more salty towards the Disney canon. There is so much EU material to adapt here and I'm sure not everything about it was bad.",1646324093,starwars,0.0

Whats your favourite star wars medium,"I've seen the fims, tv shows, read books, audiobooked and played Force Unleashed I &amp; II.

Its difficult to decide for me, as a kid the OT was phenomenal... it was three films which now isnt much, but back then it literally created an entire universe. It seemed like so much content. ROTJ was particularly good because you coukd watch it, be immersed and then run outside with friends to a garden or grove and be on Endor.

I really enjoyed being Starkiller in the games when i was older, being Vader for the opening sequence jumpstarted my childhood awe anx the games allowed that immersion i had felt as a kid runing around going pew pew pew.

Nowadays, all about the audiobooks. I love listening for hours while working, particularly when some paragraph or chapter ties in to well known events and gives it greater context, or even adds elements of subterfuge or hidden Sith control, etc.",1646306651,starwars,-0.5574

A love letter to all Star Wars actors,"I love star wars, all nine Skywalker saga films, anthology tales, shows and shorts have made my life filled with adventure and hope, wishing one day the calling of the force would come to me or if not the adventures you've all taken me down is a ride I hold very dear.

So this for you star wars actors no matter who you were in the movies from fan favorites to infamous characters, main characters and background extras, light, dark and in between. Thank you.

Lastly remember no matter how many people say bad things about your portrayal of a character know that to me you brought your all to that character and I not only appreciate all of your yard work but the legacy you've woven. I want to shout out a few specific people as well who I want to say thank for in polarizing roles: 

Ahmed Best as Jar Jar: After rewatching phantom menace your acting stands out as expressive and thoughtful, no matter how silly your character was know that Jar Jar always brightens my day and I have found a new appreciation for the importance Jar Jar has on the star wars world as a whole.

Jake Loyde as Young Anakin: No matter how canned your lines were somehow I really felt as if a kid would say that and as Young Anakin I truly felt a sense of grand adventure through Anakin's young and naive perspective. Know that you started a legacy that is fondly remembered and one I grew up loving.

Hayden Christensen as Anakin: I won't toot too much of a horn as the fanbase has grown to what I always enjoyed but know that as Anakin even with cringy dialogue to contend with your portrayal of Anakin truly shows the raw emotion that Anakin fights with. Episode 3 has some of my favorite emotional bits and acting of all time and Anakin is the forefront of that.

Daisy Ridley as Rey: For the same reasons I love Young Anakin, Rey gives me a great sense of adventure and your truly amazing acting talent shines through as the slowly growing Rey. I really hope to see you in another Star Wars project.

John Boyega as Finn: Hands down my favorite character from the sequels, your acting was a cherry on top for emotional scenes and seeing Finn any time on screen was always a treat. They did you dirty in the story department but I know the force is strong with this one.

Kelly Marie Tran as Rose: It saddens me Rose was swept to the side because despite the role you filled that was destined to be a bomb Rose stuck out as someone with an unflinching moral compass that honestly was more grounded than people give her credit for. Your acting was full of emotion that as a sibling I could truly feel for her and her ordeal. Would be glad to see Rose again on screen any time.

This may never get seen by any of the actors mentioned and that's fine, know that if you read this this is my love letter to all who breathed life into a galaxy far far away.",1646296954,starwars,0.1531

Critique my sequel idea,"So this is spoiler free kinda because Its basically a fanfic. Idk if its against the rules but…
Ep7 Finn isnt just a trooper. He is an orphaned child adopted by what will become the first order. He has a potent attraction to the force and is claimed to be a candidate to be the right hand of Snoke. Its a title that several acolytes are striving for but Finn is too kind. He was too old when he was kidnapped but his strong gift kept him alive in the ranks. On his first mission we see the savagery of the other acolytes striving to become Snokes apprentice. 
In front of him sits a young girl and Finn suffers visions of a faint memory, watching his parents be killed. He feels her connection to the force. He cant kill her and instead takes her “prisoner”. The first order flee because the new republic will be arriving soon but Finn stalls his shuttle long enough to turn himself in and escape the darkness. Several jedi accompany him in binds to the New Republic military base. 
Finn defects and promises to help them but they cant trust him. Instead they give him a short leash to be “free” and keep him in the reclaimed Jedi temple on Coruscant where Luke is the Head of the new Jedi order. But he had been on a Hiatus since an incident involving one of his students. Ben Solo had fallen to the darkness and saw that the new Jedi order was following the same path that had gotten them destroyed before. Becoming political, and forcing children to join because they were too dangerous not to be trained. He saw the padawans as almost child soldiers. Ben had seen the child slaves of Canto Byte and Tatooine and Hutt space but was disgusted that the Jedi didn’t do anything about it. 
So Finn is held in the temple when Imperial remnants and the first order launch a suicide assault on Coruscant faster than the New republic can deploy its forces. Bombardments of cannon fire barrage the surface from low atmosphere killing millions. As the temple is destroyed and Finn escapes with Rey who the current jedi council was testing for membership into the order. We see fighting in the halls of the temple as an unarmed Finn and rey run around the hastily assembled militia using old empire uniforms and tech.",1646281956,starwars,0.0

Question about Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader in the prequel trilogy,"When I watched the prequel trilogy (and the other Star Wars movies in general) I’ve known a fair bit about the plot and characters prior to watching the movies, since I watched the movies pretty late and I’ve already heard people talk about the characters or I’ve seen them in other media’s (like playing some of the games)

So when I watched the 3 prequel films for the first time, I knew that Anakin Skywalker is Darth Vader and I was seeing him developing to be him. So it was predictable for me and I already knew the outcome. 

My question is, was this the case for the original fans of the series? Like when the prequel movies first released and people watched them for the first time did they also know that Anakin is Darth Vader? Was it already confirmed through any means such as the comics or games or did the directors of the movie even announce it? 

Or was it a completely unexpected outcome and it came off as a complete surprise/plot twist when Anakin became Darth Vader?

Also in the case that it wasn’t confirmed and was indeed a surprise/plot twist, did many people predict this outcome? Like did people feel or expect that he’s going to turn out to be Darth Vader through hints or character development in the story? Or was it a huge massive surprise that almost no one knew about?

Im asking this because I want to understand the true feelings of the movies. As I said I already knew their outcome so I didn’t have that moment of surprise when Anakin turned out to be Darth Vader. 

When I watched the sequels I also knew that Darth Vader is going to turn out to be Luke’s father, but I know that this part is a surprise and a plot twist judging by the reactions I saw about it. Not sure if it’s the same case about Anakin being Darth Vader though",1646277235,starwars,0.0
Thoughts on Aspyr considering remastering Star Wars Bounty Hunter Star Wars Rogue Squadron 13 and Star Wars Trilogy Arcade for current Gaming platforms,"Hey guys, **what would you guys feel if Aspyr Media remastered Star Wars Bounty Hunter for the Switch, PC and Xbox One; Star Wars Rogue Squadron 1-3 for the Switch; and Star Wars Trilogy Arcade for PC?**

I ask because Aspyr Media has just recently given likes and responded to two people on Twitter (one of those people being me) where they were asking Aspyr if they would remaster Star Wars Bounty Hunter, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 1-3, and Star Wars Trilogy Arcade; and Aspyr said that they would indeed remaster these Star Wars games, if the demand is there and there's plenty of people that want these SW games remastered (one way to tell them we want these SW games remastered is by giving these two tweets plenty of likes and retweets so Aspyr can see that people want these games remastered).

The Book of Boba Fett rewatch,"Just rewatched TBoBF and although I liked it the first time I ran into some issues. Overall my take away from my initial viewing was it’s a flawed show that has some really cool Star Wars stuff at times.

On this second watch I actually enjoyed it more. I think because I looked forward to the cool stuff and instead of guessing or anticipating where the story was going or what would happen next. I was able to relax and just enjoy. To me this show might be better in its second viewing.",1646268489,starwars,0.0

Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie,"In my opinion it captures the heart of what Star Wars is truly about and it is the most down-to-earth. It feels the most hopeless of them all, but it brings the feeling of hope back to the galaxy far far away. It evokes so many feelings and one of them is sheer helplessness. This film really makes me understand exactly how much the Rebel Alliance had to go through in order to win. This movie does not shy away from death and it's crazy how everybody dies after playing their part in getting the plans to the rebel alliance. It's an actual War film and it was such a breath of fresh air. I was really rooting for the protagonists, and they won, but at the cost of their lives which is a tough pill to swallow, yet one rooted in everyday life. I'm so glad I re-watched this! That scene with Darth Vader is so badass but it really makes you realize what lengths the Empire was willing to go to keep those plans from getting out. Both sides had heavy death tolls and it makes me think about wars in real life and how many people have sacrificed their lives for the future of their countries, family and friends. In the end, I hope for world peace one day.",1646265259,starwars,0.1531

Why Did the Clones Lose Their Personality After Order 66,"I started watching The Bad Batch recently and this question kept bothering me.

I get the “good soldiers follow orders” thing and how the inhibitor chips keep the clones from disobeying orders, but it seems like after 66 all of the clones become aggressive, generally hostile, and for the most part lose their individual personalities that made them such interesting characters before.

Is this just a symptom of them now being “villains” and the fact rhat script writers want to dehumanize them for the convenience of keeping the moral alignment obvious, or is this an actual feature of order 66?",1646258557,starwars,-0.4019

An open letter to Disney Stop what you are doing right now and listen to your fanbase Pay the Expanded Universe authors what you owe them and make the movies we want to see,"Retcon and destroy all continuity with episodes 7, 8, and 9. I am going to go one step further than what the majority of fans have explained, detailed, and have pointed out to you. Many of you in the corporate offices may not like what we have to say, but just to let you know, we are tired of the Mistreatment of Star Wars.

You had 30 + years or storyline, lore, and plot lines to derive the newer movies from. Let's talk about what no one has mentioned. What no one has brought to the forefront...

You had the golden opportunity to adapt these novels, videogame characters, and storylines which were already within the minds of fans. To the vast majority of us, you purchased this to continue the novels and make them into real life films. Just because you decided to randomly retcon the entirety of the EU doesn't mean we do not expect it or believe it wasn't going to be filmed. You inadvertently promised us this, whether it was to your knowledge or not, and it was not what we desired. The audience is not happy and will continue to be so. 

As things currently stand with this property and franchise, there are fans online who have created movies and films out of passion that are better than your billion dollar laundering scheme. Admit it. You made the EU non-canon because you saw a golden opportunity to make money. You wanted Star Wars as a money maker. In purchasing these property rights you forgot to adapt the novels and didn't want to pay the writers who made the blueprint for you. This is why the newer films have no connection and no legacy. There aren't the spiritual successors to anything which came before. They don't show love and passion of a craft. 

You failed to make these films and to make them well. 

I think you should sell the rights back to George Lucas.",1646251591,starwars,-0.3182

Heres how I would rewrite Kylos fall in TLJ,"We start with seeing the fateful night that Ben destroys the order. The scene starts with Luke having a horrific nightmare brought on by a dark side vergence. He wakes up with a yell of lure terror, sweating and panting. He figures out that the dark side was giving him those visions, and he follows the trail of darkness to Bens room, and realizes it's coming from Ben. He uses the force to take a peak at what the heck is going on in his mind, and he has the same visions of suffering and destruction and pain that Ben will bring. It cuts to Snoke, showing that he's channeling hatred and dark sideyness into Ben, but he's covering his tracks to make it seem to Luke that it's coming from Bens own mind. Luke sees the horrific visions, and in a moment of shock and terror, staggers backward into a dresser or something, waking Ben up. Ben is full of anger and hatred from Snoke, so he starts a big argument/confrontation with Luke. As far as Luke knows, Ben's delving into darkness, and being a disrespectful punk to Luke. As a result, stern teacher Luke scolds Ben like a child. Ben loses it, attacking Luke with his lightsaber. In the fight, Luke is wounded, and the building falls down. Ben goes on a rampage, destroying everything. As he wouldn't be thinking clearly Later, he learns that Snoke was dumping horrific amounts of hatred and anger into an innocent teenagers mind, and he feels immense guilt for not realizing it. He goes to Ach To with a handful of surviving students for two reasons. One, to rebuild his order. Two, he can't bear to look Leia and Han in the eye, as he feels partially responsible for what happened. This makes a conflict between Luke and Ben, makes Ben a sympathetic and tragic villain, and Lukes character remains intact. It's not perfect, but I think it could work. Obviously, TFO and TROS would need to change to accommodate this, but I don't think that would be a major loss.",1646251181,starwars,0.0

Which is to say, what would you recommend to people who want to enjoy the EU, and what would you say is worth skipping?

For example, I really enjoyed Star Wars Legacy because it simultaneously felt familiar and yet was a substantial detour from what we had seen (all new characters, set over a century after the Battle of Yavin and decades after the Yuuzhan Vong War), and likewise much of the Old Republic content holds a special place in my heart for setting up so much lore, but I felt like the much of the ""Solo Twins"" stories overstayed their welcome over the years (Dark Nest Crisis, Swarm War, Legacy of the Force)",1646248930,starwars,0.0

Vaders other skirt,"dont know how many know this; im not the most informed fan so many might and im just out of touch, but in just one scene, as far as i know, in the original trilogy, vader has an alternate battle skirt. this one is shorter and is closed in the front and is only visable in the ROTJ. it can bee seen on vader in the scene where the rebel group approach endor with the stolen ship and clearance codes. when the camera is focused on piett at the communication console and vader can be seen walking towards him from the observation window in the background it can be clearly seen. as far as i know this is the only time we see this look used.

the thing is, i actually really like that look more. dont know why but i just completes his look a bit better in my mind, more so than the back only skirt. and its look almost gives me the vibe of a mockery of the jedi robes feeling. what are others thoughts on this? did you know or not and which look do you like better?

Hot Take Did you hate Vice Admiral Holdo It was probably the dress,"I've been on a rewatch lately and the thought occurred to me as I was skipping the scenes with her in it, except of course the one scene with arguably the most satisfactory development in her character arc. 

Holdo is notorious for being the recipient of a fair share of the fandom's ire, thanks to her sheer unpleasantness and lack of military competence but an oft overlooked element of why she's so disliked is definitely the dress. 

Let's for a moment set aside her sneering, scowling mug as she dismisses the best pilot in the fleet, or her brain-dead tactic of simply not telling anyone what the hell her plan was as the Rebels were being shot into oblivion: She's wearing a dress, a goddam BALLGOWN. Holdo is supposed to be this war hero, yet for all her alleged military chops, one of which is awareness both on the battlefield and off, perhaps someone neglected to remind her that she isn't going to dinner, but in a leadership position of a desperate ragtag group of rebels. 

The utter tone-deafness of wearing a fancy eggplant hairdo with a figure hugging number for a 'war hero' with the utterly patronizing demeanour that would be at home on an Imperial vessel cannot be overstated. She's dressed like an elite, and certainly acts like one. 

Why the dress? Why? Mon Mothma wore one, but she came from a lineage of politicians and wasn't military. Leia was literally a *princess* and even she wore military fatigues. But no, Holdo just had to look like she was looking for hors d'eouvres rather than an escape.

Maybe I'm off with this. It's definitely her moronic tactics, or her attempt at out-souring a Rancor's vomit or maybe it's the dress that earns her the contempt of pretty much everyone. 

What I do know for sure, is that it's all of the above.",1646244731,starwars,-0.34

So, wouldn't cybernetics be perfect for a Jedi? Surely there's something that could just regulate the hormones responsible for anger, fear, or impulsive decisions. If a Jedi felt they were particularly apt to feelings of anger, they could use cybernetics to balance out their emotions, which wouldn't be much different from taking medications (sidenote, do any Jedi regularly take medications? never heard of them relying on meds)

I'm sure the Jedi would prefer to resist it by willpower alone, but it doesn't make sense to never make use of something that could possibly prevent hundreds of Jedi from falling to the dark side. Of course, I suppose the Jedi would probably be against medical treatment for something like depression, they'd want to make it into some sort of trial. Still though, I think it'd be cool if some Jedi would augment their focus with implants.",1646242403,starwars,0.0

Is there a good fan edit somewhere in the final trilogy I think just adding Palpatines voice in certain spots would help unify in a little bit,"I think if you took all three movies and blender them together you might be able to pull out some thing… When Kyle is talking to Darth Vader's mask hearing Palpatine's voice communicating with him. It wouldn't know wasn't Vader :-)

What kind of edits and what would be clipped and rearranged? Make parts of the first movie flashback?

How were Force sensitives regulated under Republic,"In the original movies, Force was sort of a Judeo-Christian concept. You believe in the Force ~~Jesus/Devil~~, you get nice space magic. 

But in the prequels it turned out the force is a biological thing. You have the right bloodline/Genes/cells, you get the Force. 

So that kind of imply at least a small % of Force Users will exist in all species. Even at 0.001%, we should see hundreds of force users on every inhabited world. 

At the height of the Republics, there were 10,000 Jedis in a temple. 

How on earth did the Jedis regulate force users for example? If Mom stopped Jedis from taking little Timmy for training, then a few years down the road Timmy figured out he can use the force to convince the local cheerleader to go on a date with him or blast the bullies with a shock or two.

A decade later he is basically a ~~chaos sorcerer~~ sith warlord over his world. Fighting hundreds of other little Timmy and Johnny and Erica and Karens. 

And this would likely to happen all over the galaxy. So how did it...work out?",1646231196,starwars,0.0

New to Star Wars,"Hey all. I just ""discovered"" Star Wars recently. I saw a few when I was real young so I know names like Luke and Boba Fett and Jabba and such. 

But, with all of the side series by Disney and the original movies and this and that and the other thing coming out. I'm a bit overwhelmed.

Considering all of the movies and series that are released, what is the chronologically correct order to watch the movies and series in so it flows at least somewhat smoothly? I know by starting with The Mandalorian I was way off but it was still a great series!

Attachment in the Original Saga,"It seems since book of boba came out, the concept of ""attachment"" has come up more frequently in discussions here. I'm not going to spoil anything from the show, but I've been seeing some major misconceptions from the pre-disney material repeated fairly often in these conversations. To start with...

1. Anakin was not the ***cause*** of the order's destruction

This is pretty explicit in the films. Even if we get rid of anakin, padme, and anything and everyone ruined by the stench of ""attachment"", the jedi by the time of the prequels are very much fucked. Consider that 

A. In Attack of the Clones a set of bankers and a disgruntled ex-jedi were about to effectively one-shot the order until an army of clones inexplicably drops from the sky.

B. That army of clones was literally ordered by someone set on the order's destruction

C. Even with that army of clones, they only ever gained an upperhand due to to the excursions of one anakin skywalker(and an obi-wan kenobi) during the outer-rim sieges(the six months prior to ROTS)

D. The jedi only even figured out who ""darth sidious"" was because Anakin told them.

The destruction of the jedi order was brought about by many things, but if there was an induvidual catalyst it was Sidious. The only reason the jedi had any prayer of survival was because Sidious got ""attached""(ha) to the idea of taking the most powerful force user in history as an apprentice(and maybe there was a genuine paternal craving, who knows). Sidious originally planned to be the last and only sith but went out of his way and risked a thousand years of planning so he could walk the sky. The gamble would eventually cost him, but even as of ROTS, it was Anakin's presence that gave the jedi an opening on the chancellor they were too ""clouded by darkness"" to see. Which brings me to the next point

2. Why was anakin the chosen one?

It's arguably the most poorly handled aspects of Ani's writing in the prequel films, but regardless, Anakin was not just some powerful force user the jedi were hoping would come good. This is somewhat implied with his virgin birth, but we get a full backstory with ""the story of plagueis the wise"". Essentially, Anakin's ""dad"" was the force. 

In *Dath Plagueis***.** Sidious and Plagueis perform a galaxy-wide ritual to force the force to bend towards the darkside(at this point the darkside is simply supposed to be a cancer which the force seeks to exterminate. The whole ""dark and light must be balanced"" concept we've seen glimpses off in newer material wasn't really a thing). ***This*** is why the jedi keep repeating ""the darkside clouds everything"" during the prequel films. Again, not really a clinic of coherent writing, but this ritual is why the jedi aren't able to sense sidious is palpatine. Plagueis and Sidious are initially surprised that the force ""doesn't put up a fight"" when they perform the ritual. Later in the novel, right before plagy gets shived(by shiv), Plagueis realizes that anakin was the force's answer to the aforementioned ritual. In other words he is literally created, by the force, to ""bring the galaxy back to balance"" by exterminating the sith. He is quite literally ""the lightside"" given form. Sidious kills plagueis before he can learn this, so he ends up ""taking a keen interest"" in the boy. The point to this detour is that Anakin, narratively, is the jedi order's safety net. He's the ""break in case of emergency"". Anakin's own failure(or, depending on your point of view, delayed success) in living up to this is both a commentary on his own character defects(hubris, obsessiveness, impulsiveness), but it is also a commentary on the state of the order. The jedi were not \*doing just fine. They had indeed been doing the opposite of fine and as a result needed a savior. Then when the force, the entity that they hold above all else, handed them that savior, they fucked it up. Which brings me to my final point.

3. PT-Jedi policy was not ""the norm""

In the 25000 year history of the order, celibacy/no-love/no-attachment was only really thing for the thousand years before the prequel trilogy. It was an after-math of one of several jedi-sith conflicts the jedi had emerged victorious from over the course of their 25000 year history(the in-universe explanation for why they always eventually won is that the force actively seeks to exterminate the darkside which is why sids and plagy were trying to shift the force's balance in the first place).  

This point was also where the maximum age limit for jedi admittance was set, and it goes hand in hand with another major policy shift: the republic not having a standing army.  

The common theme with all these things is the jedi decided they needed to minimize risk with conservative policy. It's also important to understand this period was the nadir of the order's glory(fitting considering it eventually would mark its end).

 The jedi were at their least populous (it turns out convincing parents to let you kidnap babies isn't as effective for building up numbers as macking and reproducing is), their least popular(apathy and kidnapping babies really doesn't lend itself to fans), and their least effective (literally brought to their knees by a bunch of cowardly bankers). Meanwhile the senate slowly grew more and more corrupt right under their noses (this is why dooky ends up starting a civil war in the first place). The order itself was prone to shady practice(a member of the jedi council actually had multiple concubines). Which is all to say, narratively, the jedi we see enacting conservative policy aren't supposed to represent some high and mighty ideal. They represent decadence and complacency. This is portrayed pretty well in the novelization for rots(credit to matthew stover). First... ***pride***

&gt; Nine hundred years of study and training, of teaching and of meditation, all now focused, and refined, and resolved into this single moment; the sole purpose of his vast span of existence had been to prepare him to enter the heart of night and bring his light against the darkness.

...

&gt;Their clash transcended the personal; when new lightning blazed, it was not Palpatine burning Yoda with his hate, it was the Lord of all Sith scorching the Master of all Jedi into a smoldering huddle of clothing and green flesh.  
&gt;  
&gt;A thousand years of hidden Sith exulted in their victory.

...

&gt;When those blades met, it was more than Yoda against Palpatine, more the millennia of Sith against the legions of Jedi; this was the expression of the fundamental conflict of the universe itself. Light against dark.  
&gt;  
&gt;Winner takes all.

Then...***the fall***

 

&gt;It came when the avatar of light resolved into the lineageof the Jedi; when the lineage of the Jedi refined into one single Jedi.  
&gt;  
&gt;It came when Yoda found himself alone against the dark.  
&gt;  
&gt;In that lightning-speared tornado of feet and fists and blades and bashing machines, his vision finally pierced the darkness that had clouded the Force.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, he saw the truth.  
&gt;  
&gt;This truth: that he, the avatar of light, Supreme Master of the Jedi Order, the fiercest, most implacable, most devastatingly powerful foe the darkness had ever known...just—didn't—have it. ***He'd never had it. He had lost before he started.***  
&gt;  
&gt;**He had lost before he was born.**  
&gt;  
&gt;***The Sith had changed. The Sith had grown, had adapted***, had invested a thousand years' intensive study into every aspect of not only the Force but Jedi lore itself, in preparation for exactly this day. The Sith had remade themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;They had become new.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the Jedi—  
&gt;  
&gt;***The Jedi had spent that same millennium training to refight the last war.*** The new Sith could not be destroyed with a lightsaber; they could not be burned away by any torch of the Force. The brighter his light, the darker their shadow. How could one win a war against the dark, when war itself had become the dark's own weapon?

In history there's a thing called ""great man history"" where historical consensus overamplifies the role an individual plays in a pivotal event. In the history of the Star Wars universe, the Millenium long decline and, eventually, collapse of a 25,000 year old institution is much too big to lay at the feet of one individual. The jedi's defeat here was the result of everything and everyone. And ultimately, when Anakin did do what he was supposed to 30 years late, it wasn't just Anakin. It was Anakin, and his son, and his son's friends, and a rebellion that was founded before luke or leia even knew what ""rebellion"" meant. While the prequels are a personal tragedy, they're also an institutional one. What seems to hold true though, at least in the star wars universe, is that love is very powerful. This is obvious enough in Return of the Jedi, but we see it's other side in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin, now Vader, plots to overthrow Palpatine.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; He could feel his power growing, indeed. He had the measure of his ""Master"" already; not long after Palpatine shared the secret of Darth Plagueis's discovery, their relationship would undergo a sudden... transformation. 

Two sentences later...

&gt;And yet...  
&gt;  
&gt;He couldn't shake a certain creeping sensation... a kind of cold, slimy ooze that slithered up the veins of his legs and spreadclammy tendrils through his guts...  
&gt;  
&gt;Almost as though he was still afraid...  
&gt;  
&gt;She will die, you know,the dragon whispered.  
&gt;  
&gt;He shook himself, scowling. Impossible. He was Darth Vader.Fear had no power over him. He had destroyed his fear.  
&gt;  
&gt;All things die.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet it was as though when he had crushed the dragon under his boot, the dragon had sunk venomed fangs into his heel.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now its poison chilled him to the bone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even stars burn out.  
&gt;  
&gt;He shook himself again and strode toward the holocomm.  
&gt;  
&gt;He would talk to his Master.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Palpatine had always helped him keep the dragon down**.

Palpatine's true power over Anakin was that he offered anakin something the order really didn't. Where love is absent, darkness calls. On the other hand:

&gt; The ultimate goal of the Sith, yet they can never achieve it; it comes only by the release of self, not the exaltation of self. It comes through compassion, not greed. ***Love is the answer to the darkness.*** 

The ultimate goal referenced? Immortality. And it turns out, even I-hate-sand-man can do it:

I think I just figured out Boba Fetts helmet dent,"So originally as seen in attack of the clones Jango's helmet gets dented in the exact same spot by the Reek trampling him. You can see the before and after of the helmet when Mace first holds a lightsaber to Jango's neck and also when his head is cut off and the helmet flies to the ground (it can be hard to see in the early cgi but this is later confirmed in Season 2 of clone wars during death trap where Jango's helmet is used as bait.)

Now you might say: well Jango's helmet is destroyed during this attack on the side of the dent so how does that work!? Well what if the dent was not caused by Bane dueling Boba like in the ambiguous cut season (the main reason being we see Cad Bane's own blaster bolts bounce off of Nova's armour in book of Boba Fett) but rather an homage to his father as even when he repairs and repaints his armour in Mando he keeps the dent. So what if in reforging the helmet of his father and claiming Jango's armour as his birthright he embeds the dent as a way of paying the legacy of his father and the event that shaped him into a tangible reminder. Furthermore it perfectly represents Boba, the clean and honorable legacy of his Mandalorian father forever tainted for taking 1 bad job, the debt in armour that could block lightsabers.

Lastly if you say that if a blaster bolt couldn't dent the helmet why can a beast? I remind you the Din's armour was destroyed by the mud horn.",1646205333,starwars,0.0

One more of those posts my girlfriend watches all of Star Wars,"So, we have been together for over a year and she had never seen the movies or any related stuff really. Of course what sparked her interested was The Mandalorian, that I showed her the episodes in order so we could watch together, and with that... little Grogu, who the entire fan base knows and love.


Coming from that, I told her that we should watch the movies to know what the references are and she was on board.


I'm one of those fans who enjoy all of the movies for what they are so I said nothing and just let her have her opinion on everything without interference. I just told her the references that would come up here and there.


We went with the release order because she didn't know about Luke's father.


And I know nobody asked but having an outside perspective of the saga is good for this sub, maybe? So here we go.


Episode 4: she really liked the movie and found it to be very exciting. She really liked who Leia, Han and Luke became friends quick and she loved the droids. She found Vader's breath to be a very imposing sound and that his armor was amazing.
. Favorite character: old Obi-wan, the way he would help Luke connect stuff and find out his importance to the story without giving him all the sad things about his family.
. Favorite moment: when Luke looses his family and decides to go away to Alderaan, it was an important kick starter when it comes to the rest of the story in her opinion. 


Episode 5: very nice episode, she loved seeing Yoda and Luke training and she liked how Luke really went after that training. The way they separated the main characters was sad for her at the beginning but she found it good after all because of the training as well. She was surprised to see Leia and Han together, she thought she would end up with Luke, with the kiss in Hoth and all (she didn't know about the twins). She found the whole thing with Vader very sad because she was expecting Luke to be proud of his dad but in the end his dad is not a hero at all.
. Favorite character: master Yoda, after all she loves Grogu very much
. Favorite moment: Luke actually having to insist about being trained by master Yoda and sustaining that spark of hope about becoming a Jedi, and also R2 being always at his side.


Episode 6: she liked this one a lot. The plan that was in motion in Tatooine was a very good team effort and Leia was taking so many risks and showing a lot of strength. She found her to be very brave and not at all the princess in distresses and that she has the same adventures as the boys. She also thought Lando to be that guy who brings hope to some very dire situations and it was good how he does that out of nowhere. And his friendship with Han is awesome and very beautiful. She didn't really expect Vader to die, she was sad to see him go. She didn't think that evil, rigid  figure would regret anything and she found it nice that it was Luke with his love and his light side that brought him back. After all the episodes, she had the impression that in Vader there was nothing left of Anakin... Until Luke showed up :) and with that there was hope. And with that Luke finally could find the hero that was his dad.
. Favorite character: in this episode it would be Vader because she was very surprising to see him as a human being.
. Favorite moment: Luke forgiving Vader and trying to save him


Episode 1: she liked this one very much too and she loved to see Anakin winning the pod race and also loved the moment in which he has to leave and say goodbye to his mom, only to hesitate and go back for a hug. When his mom wants him to go he promises he will come back and that was very emotional. Looking back at how innocent he was, she was surprised to see that little boy was Vader. She remembers how Obi-wan didn't want to take the boy and she wonders now if Obi-wan always felt like Anakin would be difficult to train. She found Obi-Wan to be a very loyal person to the Jedi and to his master and to be one the greatest Jedi masters. Looking back it was very beautiful to see him honoring his master's wish and also being noble to teach Anakin what the Jedi are, as altruistic and good people and etc. She is looking forward to his series lmao. Also, she really liked Padme. With this episode she started seeing a trend in Star Wars that women are there to shoot, fight and take risks too. And Anakin was very cute in that one, poor child.
. Favorite character: Shmi. It was very brave and very beautiful to see his mom supporting him to have a better life, knowing full well they would not see again.
. Favorite moment: Seeing Obi-wan and Qui Gon fighting together was great and in the end seeing Obi-Wan fighting with his master's lightsaber and winning was a very beautiful moment. Also, she was baffled with Maul's double saber (and his general design).


Episode 2: she found this episode to be very nice but she never imagined that so many Jedi would die like 5they did in the arena, since she believed that they would be able to resist and face the droids. She found it sad to see so many die. She found it odd to see that Jedi can be fragile too and die in the middle of the war and was suprised and sad to see how hard it was for them to fight and survive. In the begging she didn't find Anakin and Padme a good couple because he was too much of a rebel and she was very righteous and loyal to her duty. She could feel that they really loved each other but she was way ahead of him in terms of maturity and placing her duty over her emotions, while he was the opposite, bring so impulsive. She didn't think he would give in to the feelings. After everything she found it beautiful to seem them together but it was already obvious that this wouldn't end up well, lmao. About ""those guys on a round stone table"" she found them evil and manipulative. She found the separatists hard to argue with and that everything was really going towards conflict. She liked how Yoda was fighting because it showed well his ability with the Force and the lightsaber, not being fragile as he would look and being a very balanced guy.
. Favorite character: Jango Fett. His attempt to teach and be there with Boba was well shown. She didn't imagine that Boba of all people would have that deep story and that his dad would be there by his side.
. Favorite moment: when Anakin looses his arm. Not that the scene is beautiful at all, but it was a very strong moment. She didn't imagine that something like that would happen to Anakin and it hit her like a jump scare lmao. 


Episode 3: that was the very sad episode of the bunch. She thought that if the Jedi had trusted him more things would have been different. Not trusting him maybe made his head spin so much that allowed Palatine to manipulate him further. She thought that the fragility of the Council and of the Jedi were showed on this episode and the representation here was that the Jedi are not perfect heroes but people with mistakes. Anakin would need more trust not to dive into the dark side like he did and Palatine really took the opportunity here to promise him what he would never have (and give him comfort that he couldn't find with the Jedi). At least Obi-Wan was there for him. Padme's death was something that she didn't expect as well. She was very sad to see how Anakin feet and the saddest thing was seeing Obi-wan suffering and crying when leaving Vader to burn. Also, she was really impressed to see four lightsabers at once with Grievous and baffled to see Anakin force choking Padme.
. Favorite character: Bail Organa. The way he was there to support the situation even though he had nothing to do with anything was noble. He gave himself to protect a child and this was really out of a good heart.
. Favorite moment: the Skywalker family end. Specially when Obi-wan takes Luke to Owen and Beru and when, during Padme's funeral, we can see everyone so sad. This showed how much of a symbol she was. Nothing would take away her image of righteous and what she meant to the people


Episodes 7, 8 and 9 (which we watched in two days since she was hooked lol): very good trilogy. She found it very sad when Han died and seeing Chewy suffering was very hard. She wasn't expecting a character like Rey, it was a nice surprise for her. Also she would never expect Luke as a recluse and bitter person, it broke her hearth and she found it very bad to see him with no will and no hope after all the fight that she saw during the OT. She also found it very dissapointing to see Han and Leia so apart because it was obvious that they loved each other very much. She liked how Finn let go of his life and beliefs in order to live differently and better, it was very brave of him and it made for an awesome character. She never in a million years would expect Rey to be Palatine's granddaughter and it was beautiful to see her and Leia hug, having Leia basically adopting her in a way. Seeing Rey insist with Luke was good for the story and also very fundamental for Luke, to help him find meaning again, and this is pretty nice. Also, adopting the Skywalker name was a beautiful moment and a nice closing for the saga. She also liked her going ""I'm all the Jedi"". 
. Favorite characters: Finn, Luke, Rey and Rose (she found Rose to be a very good surprise and significant to the idea of being loyal to a cause).
. Favorite moments: Rey Skywalker, Finn killing Phasma and a very remarkable scene but not very happy, Han being killed and having Chewy so sad :/ 


Rouge One: she liked that one very much. It was very nice thar new characters are always showing up and that they are usually just regular people for the galaxy. Jyn was a good example of that for her. She liked where Jyn lived with her parents and having the family always at risk and trained to run was a very nice touch. It was awesome how this movie showed the other side of the Empire, as in showing how Galen wasn't a bad person but was still working for them (so far she had seen only people full of hate and evil in the Empire). She liked Saw Guerreira too and how the movie showed the other side of the Rebels, the extremists who make things more difficult than they help. Also seeing Vader was an awesome surprise.
. Favorite character: Galen, being so altruistic and brave.
. Favorite moment: when Galen admits his guilt to save his co-workers as Krenic asks who warned the cargo pilot. Also, when he died and Jyn hugs him one last time, knowing that Galen did what he could to help and protect her, and not just letting her go with Saw with no further development.


Solo: very good and very fun movie. She liked seeing the young Han doing the same stuff as old Han (like being witty and all). Also seeing him from another point of view, looking at all the way that lead him to be the scoundrel. It was nice to see him and Qi'ra together and it would have been nice to see their story together. Their feelings for each other didn't go away and this was a nice thing to see: she made a sacrifice of letting him go just to see him succeed and put him out of the aim of Crimson Dawn. She wouldn't leave her position she was for him and she didn't want him to let go of who he is for her. It was also very nice to see Han and Chewbacca meet. She didn't expect to see Chewy as a monster at all. Also, knowing and seeing the Falcon and it's story was awesome, she loved to see that on the movie and how he got it. 
. Favorite character: Chewbacca. A highlight for her was seeing Chewbacca dropping the job to help his people, she found it very good to see his aspiration and loyalty, it really showed him as more than just Han's buddy. Where is the Chewbacca series?
. Favorite moment: When he wins the Falcon. The final game was fun.




Also, I showed her some series, which would make for a whole other post but it is worth mentioning:



The Book of Boba Fett: she loved the series. It was very nice to see Mando and Grogu there out of nowhere. It was very surprising to see the sand people like that, she found them to be monsters before this series. A highlight in the series was when Boba got his gaffi stick.


The Mandalorian: this is her favorite star wars content out of everything. Her favorite thing is the story of Mando and Grogu. Seeing Luke as a Jedi master there and in Boba Fett was awesome (and about that, in Boba, she didn't expect at all that Grogu would choose Mando and was happy and surprised)


The Bad Batch: she loves Omega. It was sad to see Kamini go. For her it was another Mando and baby with Hunter and Omega. She really liked to be shown another point of view when dealing with the clones, by showing them as human, people, who can give love too.


LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales: it was very fun, albeit a bit strange to see everyone so ""squared"". I might have to show her the other specials.


Clone Wars (2003): she doesn't remember this one much because she is confusing it with canon material lmao. She proposed watching again :) which we will.



So that is it. I'm happy to share stuff with her and also my mom and dad and thought you all would want to know about an outsiders opinion.",1646201129,starwars,-0.5574

How were the Clone Wars meant to begin,"I'm going to assert that the the events of AoTC were pretty far outside of Palpatine's plan, such as the fact that the Jedi stumbled upon the GAR as opposed to having Sifo-Dyas' order being filled shortly after the Military Creation Act is passed. Which again, doesn't get passed as a result of Padmé surviving the attempts on her life. Additionally, Obi-Wan stumbling upon the GAR on Kamino leads him to Geonosis where he find Dooku and the Rest of the Separatist council.

I think it's a safe bet that Palpatine didn't want to risk having Dooku, Jango, Grievous (in the catacombs) and the Separatist council all being captured in the first battle of the war, ending it before it started.  Which begs the question, when or where do you think Palpatine had chosen as the inciting incident or battle of the Clone Wars?",1646199021,starwars,-0.5574

What if Anakin never became Vader

What if Qui Gon didn't die

What if Anakin Killed Obi Wan

What if Luke and Leia's roles were switched

What if Ben never became Kylo Ren

What if Alderaan wasn't destroyed

What if Hosnian Prime wasn't destroyed (because that ending for the New Republic sucked)

What if the New Republic didn't dissolve its Military

What if the Alliance made use of the Remnants of Jabbas Criminal Empire to establish the New Republic (now that would be cool, or if they just used its resources)

What if the Separatists got a hold of the Clones first

What if the Empire won the Galactic Civil War

What if Yoda used the Pillar to kill Dooku (yes that is a reference to HISHE)

What if The Empire kept the Clones

What if The CIS still existed after the establishment of the Empire (Three Way Galactic Civil War FTW!!! it could also be related to the above what if)

Even Commandos are numbers and nothing more,"Was replaying the old star wars republic commandos game, and it occurred to me just how human and disposable the characters are at the same time. You’d think that the characters having distinct personalities like 07s hardcore and killer, 40s techy and average, 62s explosive loving foolhardiness and of course the tactical leadership of 38, after all this time operating together with different voices even, they never considered themselves as anything beyond a number. 

I was hacking a console and one guy yelled “38 behind you!” And I just responded like it was my name. That sort of hit home that these guys despite how clunky and confusing numbers are as individuals can be, it works. They are accustomed to being a number, a cog, a faceless gun among a sea of flesh and bone.

When you get downed, their first response if in combat is not concern or worry.

“Sir, protocol dictates I can’t get you until all hostiles are clear.”

Really sets a darker tone when you start noticing how much these guys as human as they are, act a lot like droids.",1646184431,starwars,0.0

From my understanding darth sidious is stated to be the most powerful sith Lord in historywhy Canonlegends,"This is not hate to sidious however I always see people state he is the most powerful.

Is it based of his lightsaber skills? 

Is it based of his force feats? Which it what I think of....in Canon I agree he is the most powerful currently...but in legends I would argue some old republic sith Lords were miles ahead

Celebration 2022 tickets,"MTFBWYall:

I’m a crazy one that never even knew about Celebration 2-3 year ago, and therefore didn’t know to buy tickets. But, (I may be crazy) I’ve already booked a hotel and bought Disney and Universal tickets to enjoy DisneyLand with my wife and daughter the week before Celebration. (So, even if I can not find Celebration tickets, I can still enjoy our vacation)

So, I have 3 thoughts/questions/pleas:

1.	If anyone has any knowledge of where I could by a single ticket for myself for 1 or all 4 days that will not cost $1,500…. Please I beg of you… let me know. I of course want to pay for the ticket/s but I simply can not afford $1,500 on a small church pastor’s salary, ha ha ha ha

(I’ve submitted my Generic Jedi (and hopefully my Old Ben costume soon trying to find a wig) to the Rebel Legion in the hopes I might find some more online communities there, too, to ask around about ticket possibilities. I’m really hoping Celebration will be the first time I can show off all my hard work of my costume/s)

2.	If anyone is going to Celebration and offering any get togethers in the evenings or lunch times, I’d love to say hello and attend Celebration vicariously through you, by hearing all about it when you are not in the floor or attending sessions.
3.	Any news if the Celebration organizing team are planning on possibly releasing any tickets that were returned due to the date change? I’d be honored to volunteer or help any tables or the committees, too. (If there is a waiting list, or something like that)

Thanks so much in advance everyone! Blessings and peace be with you all!",1646170521,starwars,0.0

Force Ghost limitations,"Hi all, I was wondering if It is possible that a force ghost can only appear to a living person who actually knew the dead force user, or at least had knowledge that they existed. For example, I can't currently think of a time in the core 9 movies that a force ghost ever appears to anybody that they didn't know in life. Is this true in the extended canon and Legends as well? Has anybody ever interacted with a force ghost of someone they had never met while that person was alive? Is there a requirement of knowing something about the person, like hearing stories, or have force users been visited by force ghosts they know nothing about?",1646162521,starwars,-0.3182

I flipping hate Omega from Bad Batch,"The title really explains this post quite well. I hate Omega from Bad Batch with a passion. I'm currently 4 episodes deep, and I'm seriously considering quitting the show. She should really have stayed with Cut. She is like early-stage Ahsoka, just annoying. 

I went into this show with high expectations. Watching more of Echo is exactly what I have wanted since the citadel episode. The show is good, I like all the major characters, and the storyline is interesting, but I just can't stand Omega. Having a young girl on this show is just wrong, had it been a young boy, I would have felt the same. I guess I was hoping for a continuation of season 7 of CTW. The show feels like the early seasons of clone wars, but the targeted audience is a bit lower, and obviously, the nostalgia can't save it.",1646156944,starwars,-0.8173

Crosshair Imperial Death Trooper Commander ,"Hello guys!

Ever since I saw “The Bad Batch” and Crosshair's new Imperial armor I thought he would raise ranks and become the first Death trooper (who knows? Maybe we're going to see something like this in Season 2), so I tried to imagine how the character would look in that iconic, dreadful black armor. Also, I tried to visualize a new deluxe packaging inside cover for Hasbro figures like this Crosshair (Death Trooper Commander), a mix between “Star Wars Battlefront II” menus aesthetic and Visual Guides layout: data files, a longer description for the character and lots of details about his gear/equipment. It would definitely be cool to have something like this in hand, sporting the comic book-based packaging already seen with Darth Maul (Sith Apprentice), Jaxxon or Luke Skywalker &amp; Ysalamiri! Do you like it? Would you buy this?

Would the squeals work as a TV show,"I think a lot of us can remember not liking the prequel trilogy. However, the Clone Wars (2008) helped redeem a lot of aspects that fell sort of flat. The characters were well written and the story arcs were phenomenal. I loved The Clone Wars, it was a part of my childhood and it stays dear to heart to this day. I feel like the squeal trilogy could have some parts of it ""fixed."" If Dave Filoni or someone else were to work on a show that could introduce aspects between TFA, TLJ, and TROS or after those movies, then maybe we would come to appreciate the squeal trilogy more. I'm still not a fan of the sequels, but I still sort of like TFA because it introduced some neat ideas like the First Order and Starkiller base. Could they have worked?

I dont understand the plot of Attack of the Clones,"AotC is probably my least watched of all the OT and PT movies, so I’m already a bit weak on what happens but I remember it for the most part. One thing that I never got though was the plot surrounding the clone army and Jango Fett. I thought that Palpatine, or one of his pawns, ordered the clone wars but the movie is pretty clear Sifo-Dyas (sp?) did it in secret and he was in fact a Jedi master. But he was also supposed to have died before the clone order was put in, so does that mean Dooku was only using his name? The movie never really makes this clear. Also, Jango Fett. Why is HE after padme? He apparently works for the republic if he’s the base for the clones, but then he’s working for the separatists because he’s trying to kill padme? Does this help support the idea that the sith was indeed behind the clone creation and only used a fake Jedi master name and it was just too subtle for me to pick up on?",1646083228,starwars,-0.4767
This is messing with my mind Is Vaders footage somewhat looped in the No I am your father scene,"Hear me out. This is the scene: https://youtu.be/_lOT2p_FCvA , as you must have seen a million times.

Right before the camera cuts to Luke after the famous line, at around 1:10, the footage of Vader seems to start going in reverse, as if it was looped. I don’t know how to say it correctly but I think you understand me. 

It’s very subtle. Look at his right shoulder, or between his eyes, or the top of the helmet. They suddenly change directions without any deceleration.

SPOILERS JEDI FALLEN ORDER and CLONE WARS I have an answer for how to unite the Fandom,"... and her name is Trilla. 

Trilla hits me in the heart in a 90's Gothic metal sort of way. She's this sexy Italian looking girl who can fight. She's dangerous and confident. She can kick my ass in Fallen Order. She does so while talking shit and telling me I can't win.

I don't need the expanded universe made. I do not require prequel trilogy memes of original trilogy memes. 

I just need more Trilla. The new sex bomb of Star Wars. I don't need Princess Leia in a slave bikini. I do not need Padme in her little Geonosian outfit with her stomach exposed. I don't need Rey. I don't need Ashoka as cool and awesome of a Jedj she is.

I do however, need Trilla's death to be retconned somehow and for her to be brought back. She has presence and was cool. 

I don't even need Revan or Mara Jade. 

The force is Trilla and only Trilla.

Make these retcons happen Disney. If you can bring back Palps or Maul
... you can bring back Trilla. 

Maybe Vader turned off lethal mode and just hit her with the ""knock out"" part of the lightsaber.",1646076394,starwars,-0.4995

How many did you know,"1. Yoda was almost played by a monkey.
George Lucas originally planned for Yoda to be played by an adorable monkey wearing a mask and carrying a cane.

2. ‘Ewok’ is never actually said in the original trilogy.
The name of the cuddliest species in the galaxy is never actually spoken by any character in the films. The species is only identified in the script and closing credits.

3. Return of the Jedi almost had a very different ending.
George Lucas toyed with the idea that after Luke removes a dying Vader’s helmet, he puts it on and proclaims, “Now I am Vader” and turns to the dark side.

4. Depending on the movie, Yoda has a different number of toes.
In The Phantom Menace, Yoda has three toes. But in The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and the Sith, he has four.

5. Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey had the same production crew.
George Lucas admired Stanley Kubrick’s work so much that he hired as many people who worked on 2001 as he could. The group was referred to as ‘The Class of 2001’.

6. E.T. was in The Phantom Menace (kind of).
The alien race of E.T. makes an appearance in Episode 1, officially connecting the worlds of George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg sci-fi.

7. Chewbacca’s voice is a mix of other animals.
Chewbacca’s signature voice is a mix of bears, walruses, lions, badgers and – rather worryingly – a mixture of dying animal sounds.

8. Lightsaber noises came from an old television.
The trademark lightsabre sounds were created by combining the hum of an old television’s picture tube and the buzz of a film projector’s motor.

9. Harrison Ford almost wasn’t.
Han Solo, Burt Reynolds was a top contender to play Han Solo, along with Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Christopher Walken.

10. Darth Vader is banned from all official Star Wars parties.
David Prowse, the actor who portrayed Darth Vader (in form, not voice), is banned from attending Star Wars conventions and parties because George Lucas finds him annoying",1646061989,starwars,0.0

Its showrunner is the person who did rewrites on Rogue One in addition to having an impressive filmography in general.

Have you listened to the Star Wars audio plays,"I was searching for something to listen to on youtube and found the audio plays. At first I thought it was just going to be the audio from the movies with some descriptive narration, but then I noticed it was 5 hours long.

This is actually a really high-quality project -- I am blown away by how good it is! I don't know who wrote this, but this is spectacular. I'm guessing a novelist or a very skilled playwright because the character building and character interaction is top notch. The first bit really spends time with Luke on Tatooine, interacting with the other teens. His uncle pressures him into working on the farm (for his own safety), some of the kids dislike him because he wants to leave and they think he thinks he's better than him. The only support he gets is from Biggs, who isn't around any more because he's a pilot in the resistance. I'm only an hour in and it's got it's talons into me, I can't turn it off.

I can't say enough about how well the characters are being shaped here. I already know future events in the story are going to have a huge impact because of this.

Mark Hamill is doing the voice of Luke, which just makes it so easy to immerse you in what's going on. He's so good at anything he does and he really acts well with just his voice. You can picture the gestures he's doing because his voice is just so expressive.

I highly recommend you listen to these. Sorry if you already know about these, but I got my post deleted at r/movies for talking about this (they don't allow discussion of big franchises) and really want to recommend this for people who might be interested and don't know about it.",1646055229,starwars,-0.3818
Does anyone else have to cope with this problem,"I'm part of a generation that was around during Return of the Jedi's cinematic release. I consumed pretty much everything there was with a Star Wars tag on it. The entire expanded universe book collection still on my shelves, and of course read and loved regularly. I played every game I came across. I don't really dislike anything SW, even liked the sequel trilogy for what it is. 

And now comes the tricky part. Stating opinions or facts in the SW forum will be punished with a hailstorm of downvotes and hate, no matter how right you are, even if it's just an opinion. 

That makes me always think about the episode ""Majority Rule"" from The Orville. The fanbase just blindly hacking on the downvote button while not even realising what they're doing to people.

Okok I will give the animated series a shot But in which order,"I’ve been a Star Wars fan for a long time, but the animated series never caught my attention.

I always had the feeling (and deep inside they still do, a bit) they are for kids.

But more and more I come to the realization that im missing out on quite some stories, characters etc.

So: in what order should I watch them?

Its Rebels, Clone Wars and Bad Batch. Right?",1646051517,starwars,0.0

Possible unpopular opinion I have no problems with the line Somehow Palpatine has returned,"Given how convoluted it was as a plot point, how is some Joe Shmoe fighter pilot supposed to understand Force ghosts inhabiting cloned husks? I’m sure the Clone Wars are still public knowledge at that point, but it seems in The Mandalorian that the Jedi have descended into myth and the ways of the Force more so. Yeah, Poe had witnessed some Force powers but at that point, for the sake of expediency when explaining the situation to a large group of people, I would probably say the same thing.",1646038199,starwars,-0.5994

Watched Clone Wars 2003 for the first time actually really good,"I'll be honest I kind of liked the art style better than 08/09 Clone Wars, I mean Clone Wars animation isn't bad and it definitely improves around season 3 or 4, but I think 2D animation is just better in general and honestly I felt it fits Star Wars more. In general I felt Clone Wars 2003 fits better with the movies, don't get me wrong I love Filoni's Clone Wars series, it provided us with a lot and expanded upon the lore much more, however the first fee seasons of Clone Wars were alright. 2D Clone Wars I felt Anakin and Obi Wan fit more closely to their prequel counterparts and the clones were really cool in it. Another thing is I think it kind of fits with the timeframe more, as Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith are supposedly 3 years apart. However with everything rhat happened in 09 Clone Wars it seems longer than 3 years, seems like its been 5 (by the time we see Anakin in the 09 series its implied at least a year passed imo, he has different hair, and also armor, and no longer a padawan). It would've been cool to see more of that art style from the 03 series in 09 Clone Wars. Genndy Tartakovsky should get a chance to work on something again for Star Wars for a new animated series. Maybe a series that takes place before the Clone Wars movie and after Attack of the Clones, or maybe a series taking place from the perspective of a stormtroopers. Either way I think he should be brought back as his series is really good, and also made me remember that I actually owned Star Wars figurines based off his 03 Clone Wars series.",1646031793,starwars,-0.1045
My Opinion on Vader and Palpatine,"Ok, so I'm not quite sure if anyone or everyone else has this same opinion, but, I personally believe that Anakin himself is very strong yes, but his darker counter part ""Vader"" isn't necessarily weaker by that much. I believe the only reason Palpatine is considered stronger than Vader is due to the mental grasp sheev had on Ani/Vader, and take note of the fact that Vader's suit made him pretty powerful (while inflicting pain) yes, but sheev also had the upper hand there, seeing as he forged the suit to be sensitive to force lightning. I feel that if Vader wanted, he could have had a chance against Palpatine if he modified his suit, and were as brave as we was during his time with the Jedi. Thank you.",1646031437,starwars,0.0

I remember reading somewhere that a Jedi is only considered a Master if their Padawan successfully becomes a Jedi Knight. So, by that, the reason Anakin wasn't a Master was because Ahsoka left. And would break Obi-Wan's Master title when Anakin fell to the Dark Side.

Illogical Star Wars Fanfic by Me Episode I Padme,"Padme actually didn't die in Revenge of the Sith. She just lost her memory because she thought she had enough. She went on to live in Corouscant as a Chancellor for the rest of her days until she met BB-8 one day in 5 ABY and travelled to Ach-To to study the ways of the Jedi so she could become one and defeat the Dark Lard Called Vayder. When she battled him, she instantly defeated him because she was too strong in the force. She went onto be the Great Grand Master of the New New Newest Jedi Council which was then raided by Jar Jar to bring back the Ancient Jar Empire which stored food in a Jar. However Padme didn't like foods in jars, she liked them in boxes. Therefore the 100 year Box vs Jar war begun in 30 ABY. in 130 ABY, Padme defeated Jar Jar with the help of Revan who she later then well in love with. Anakin who was watching these events unfold killed Revan in an instant and then raged and went extragalactic to never return for 500 years. fast forwards to 777 ABY, Anakin returned to find the galaxy same again.",1646028968,starwars,-0.5574

Spoilers If the Galactic Starcruiser Hotel and Galaxys Edge are canon how does that fit with the sequel trilogy,"In the Disney canon, Rey is spending time training with Leia in between TLJ and TROS, isolated. Although, in the theme parks, she’s very active within the Resistance and has encountered Kylo Ren twice in between the last two movies, if not more. In Galaxy’s Edge, they are seen dueling in front of Droid Depot. In the Starcruiser, Rey is protecting a Jedi holocron from Kylo Ren for some reason. It seems their ambiguous bond and lack of narrative are being opportunistically used by Disney for their parks. If the parks were OT, Disney could not do the same with Luke and Vader because the movies have a clear narrative and arc (i.e. Luke can’t fight Vader on Batuu). Is this Disney milking the pair for easy lightsaber entertainment in their parks? Is this how Disney explains how the Resistance’s numbers grew from 500 to much more in between TLJ and TROS? Is this a possible addition to the Disney canon hinting at a future with Rey leading a Jedi order? Why would Disney use a hotel to debut a new film plot? What’s going on with Disney and Star Wars?",1646022856,starwars,0.3612
Gungi would be the deadliest jedi ever,"In the Young Jedi Arc in The Clone Wars, one of the younglings was a wookie named Gungi. This guy would probably be a freaking beast in battle.

Also, he has proficiency with a lightsaber, making him a good fighter. Soif he was fully grown and was up against a big group of enemies all at once, he would probably defeat them all in a 4 or 5 minutes.",1646021770,starwars,0.0

Cool but,"Mando and the different prequel things are great but its kind of pointless knowing it all just builds up to ROS. At the same time, the amount of inconsistencies, plot holes, and ret-cons make me wish the whole thing could be redone. Rebooting would be terrible though. 

So maybe toss everything forward in time beyond the sequel trilogy. Start fresh with the scenes on Degaoba being the main influence and vibe. Characters learning to look past the fast-paced, futuristic, high-tech world they live in to find balance with theirselves and nature. No sith and jedi stuff. Just use of the force on a primal level while trying not to be overcome by it. 

Maybe im overthinking things but thats the movie I want to see.",1646015941,starwars,0.3182
Death Watch  Clone Wars v The Mandalorian,"Not sure if there's an actual question here, or if I'm just putting it out there for general discussion.

When The Mandalorian first aired, I hadn't seen any of The Clone Wars, Rebels, or The Bad Batch, so the show was my first introduction to Mandalorians, Death Watch, etc.  More recently I've watched all of Clone Wars, and I was struck by how different the portrayal of Death Watch is. They're straight up bad guys - they hate the Jedi, and they joined with Maul to violently overthrow the peaceful Mandalorian government.   I'm find it hard to reconcile this with Din Djarin, who is a good, moral person.  He claims to have been raised by the Death Watch, but doesn't really behave like them at all other than in mostly symbolic ways such as never taking is helmet off.

I understand that other people have to play the character, but this dude already owns it.

What to do with my life,"So I always had a mild interest in star wars but never fully got into it, even though my brother was a huge fan. A few weeks ago I got high and decided I was gonna watch all (well most) of the movies/ Disney series' in chronological order to see he loved them so much.

So I began with Phantom Menace, and every night for the last few weeks I came home from work got high and continued my star wars journey. I took a long gap between Aotc and Rots to watch through all of the clone wars series, and holy shit this was my favorite of the lot. Its probably been said loads before but it adds so much more depth to the characters, the world and the clone wars in total, truly top tier star wars content. I found myself getting completely invested in characters I barely knew much about before. I found Asajj Ventress' arc to be one of the best and found myself rooting for her towards the end. Ashokas development in the later seasons is great and I love how we got to see more of jedi that don't get much airtime in the movies. Characters like Mace Windu and Plo Koon. Also Maul with the darksaber vs Sidious, inject that shit into my veins, this show had some of the best moments in the series. I watched a supercut of last episodes of season 7 along with Rots switching back and forth between the two for the full experience, and holy shit it gave me chills. 

After this I watched through Rebels (I hadnt really got much interest in the spin off movies) and just when I thought nothing could compare this to CW, Rebels goes and does just that. Although I wasn't a huge fan of the change in art style, this series gave some of the best moments in the franchise, Ashokas face off with Vader being one of them.

The sequels were great too, even though I have to say I definitely prefferred the prequels. After these I jumped straight into the Mandalorian. This was way better than I expected it to be. It was amazing to see all these characters that id come to know love be brought into live action, people like Ashoka and Bo Katan. And of course we have to talk about the star of the show, Grogu! He is the cutest thing in the world and no one can tell me otherwise. This is the way. 

Next up was Book of Boba Fett, and when I heard that this would continue the Madolorians storyline I got super hyped. And honeslty after clone wars I have to say this was a close  second. I thought it started a little slow but the later episodes really made up for that. Getting to see &gt;!Ashoka meet Luke!&lt; was so cool but my favorite moment of the show by far was when &gt;!Cad Bane showed up!&lt; , I marked out I'm ngl.

Thing is now I'm finished watching everything I was really interested in watching, now I don't know what to do. I came home from work tonight and had a giant star wars size hole in my evening. I know its awhile before we get Kenobi and Ashokas series' so what do you think I should watch in the mean time? Are the side films worth watching? And what about the new trilogy, is it really as bad as everyone says it is? I don't know any of the characters or have any idea of what they're about so should I just bite the bullet and watch them? Are they any good youtube channels covering comic arcs I should check out? What do you guys think?",1646011247,starwars,0.0

Obi Wan and Anakin have an interestingly similar taste in women,"Just a thought I had. Both Satine and Padme are politicians who prefer discussions over conflict and both fell in love with a Jedi. 

This also adds to the credibility of a ROTS deleted plot point, in which Palpatine implies that Padme is cheating on Anakin with Obi Wan. With Anakin's knowledge of Satine, his suspicion of Padme throughout the latter half of ROTS makes a lot more sense",1646009802,starwars,0.4019

Seeing the Despecialized Version of Star Wars on the big screen,"Growing up I have always been a fan of Star Wars, especially A New Hope. Star Wars has always been one of the earliest movie memories I have and it started with the CBS Fox video tape. Even when the Special Editions of the original movies came out I still watched the old VHS tape that we still had. I have never seen the Special Editions in theaters ( I was seven and had no opportunity to see them since we lived out of country). 

For a long time I have always wanted to see A New Hope in theaters, even if it was the Special Edition. When I heard that my local theater was having a screening of this film, I immediately bought a ticket.

Grogu and Mando reuniting so soon has Disneys corporate meddling written all over it," It just felt like they weren’t confident in Din’s character to keep him away from grogu. In fact a lack of confidence is what made this entire show very dull imo since they  ditched Boba and gave Din the spotlight for 2 whole episodes. Also the emotional ending  of Mandalorian Season 2 was ruined for me.

 They rushed their reunion so quickly for no other reason then to sell more merchandise it feels. Not only that, but really everything that happened with Din felt rushed to me: him being kicked out of the Mandalorian religion, building a new ship, dealing with not having a purpose and falling back into his old occupation. All of these interesting concepts were rushed into the span of one episode, where I feel if they had spaced them out over the course of a season, they would have worked much better.

 I was hoping that we would see basically a two sided stir for mando season 3. We would get the story that I’m assuming is what we are still getting with mando seeking out Bo Katan and working to reclaim mandalore while on the other side of the coin we would see grogu training with Luke and all the while we get to see the two of them struggling in different ways about missing one another",1646000601,starwars,0.0

Kylo stancesaber and Harry Potter,"After learning more about the dark saber: you need to kill or beat its owner to gain its control. If you don’t, it won’t ‘listen’ to you and becomes very heavy/unwieldy.

This unwieldy dark saber stance/condition reminds me of the stance of Kylo Ren. He often points it to the ground. Also; when he swings his saber it -seems- to cost him more effort than other saber wielders.

This is combination with the appearance of Kylo’s saber; not smooth because of the broken crystal.. gave me some interesting thoughts.

And then Harry Potter: I hear you think Wtf?
The ‘beating its owner’-thingy reminds me of the wands in Harry Potter. Someone elses wand only truly listens to you if you beat/disarm/kill its previous owner.

The Tuskens in Book of Boba Fett,"I have mixed feelings on how *Book of Boba* incorporated the Tuskens. (Spoilers below.)

A lot of it was amazing. It was really important for them not to just be mindlessly violent ""Sand People,"" i.e., fictional stand-ins for real life indigenous or colonized people. *Book* did a great job of fleshing out their personhood and their culture in a way that built on rather than undermined the way they were portrayed in the OT, for instance. The fact that it was a chance for Temuera Morrison and the creators to introduce variations on Maori culture in real life was excellent. Too often Star Wars echoes real-life racism and colonialism, and this was a great corrective to that.

And then...it went nowhere. The Tuskens who saved Boba and changed him as a person are massacred, and then we don't see any other Tuskens for the rest of the series! The massacred is referenced, but only as a plot point and a pain point for Boba. You realize that all the work those first couple episodes did isn't really about the Tuskens at all, but just a plot device and a way to develop Boba's character. It's completely instrumental, and for me that undercuts a lot of what was good about those episodes. It makes me feel like the creators of the show (here I'm excluding Morrison) only cared about the Tuskens insofar as it served Boba's development, and otherwise were happy to toss them in the scrap heap. It didn't have to be either or: they could continue to matter to Boba even as they continued to have a role in the plot and in life on Tattooine, on their own terms. A lot of us predicted that might happen. But that's not the direction they went.

My understanding of Lott Dod,"I was always confused on how he and the TF could still be in the Republic while also being in the CIS. Then, while rewatching “Supply Lines,” I think I finally got it.

In the episode (if I remember correctly), Dod refers to Nute Gunray as an extremist and that they don’t support him.

So…let me see if I got this right:

Dod claims that Gunray and his forces are a splinter group broken off from the actual Trade Federation to join the CIS. That he basically has stolen a ton of their droids and ships (that the TF used as security forces) and repainted them for his own use. That’s why the CIS Vulture Droids and MTTs are blue instead of brown like the TF Vultures and MTTs from TPM. That’s he’s falsely claiming to be a part of the TF when he really isn’t anymore.

As long as no one catches Dod openly supporting the CIS, they can’t criminalize the TF and jail him.

Fixing the Biker Gang from The Book of Boba Fett,"The Book of Boba Fett has proven to be a divisive series for Star Wars fans. One aspect in particular being the Biker Gang that Fett hires as his henchmen.

Introduced in episode 3, this gang of misfit youths appeared drastically out of place on the desert planet of Tatooine, with their cybernetic body parts; slick, punky outfits; and, most controversial of all, shiny colorful speeders that traveled at the rapid pace of one mile per hour. 

However, I was willing to give all of that a pass so long as these characters were properly fleshed out and entertaining - in other words, if they were actually written well and served a significant purpose to the plot.

With the series now concluded, I can say with the utmost confidence that this was not the case, with these characters being severely underdeveloped and outright boring - a humongous injustice on the part of the showrunners, who were instead more concerned with flashbacks to Fett's past as well as kicking off The Mandalorian Season 3.

So how do we fix them? It's simple: flesh out their aesthetics.

You see, while the gang sticks out like a sore thumb on Tatooine, they would fit perfectly on the city world of Coruscant. So make that their home world and explain - or better yet, SHOW - how they came to be a gang and how they ended up on the desert planet. That gives them a backstory, laying the foundation for their character arcs.

(DO NOT leave it to be explained on some spinoff EU novel or Wookiepedia entry because that is not how you write characters you want your audience to like.)

Now that your characters have a backstory to be explored, you can develop their arc. 

when Boba Fett first meets the gang, have him or even Fennec Shand (though preferably Fett himself) take note of their squeaky clean, youthful appearance and come to the conclusion that:

1. They are foreigners to the planet
2. They lack experience
3. They won't survive unless they receive the correct discipline.

This leads to a mentor-student between Fett/Shand and the gang where they frequently put them to the test and note their level of skill and where they need improvement.

Episode 3 itself presented 2 opportunities for this:

1. Black Krrsantan invading Boba's Palace and attacking him. Instead of having the gang successfully stop the Wookie and all's well that ends well, have Fett chastise his entire staff for letting their guard down, which enabled Krrsantan to sneak in undetected. 
2. The Speeder chase. Easily the single most controversial and panned moment from the show, this could have actually been used to the plot's advantage and opened up and opportunity for development of the gang and Fett's relationship with them. Have him send them out to chase down the majordomo, BUT he gives them a time limit. Have the gang cause total havoc in the streets as they did, looking like complete buffoons and just when the majordomo seems to have escaped them, have Fett land on the hood of his speeder using his jetpack, grab him by his collar out of his seat, and take off into the air once more, sending the speeder crashing into a nearby building - Fett then pins the blame of that collateral damage entirely on the gang for failing to capture the majordomo in time.

What this can then lead to is tension between Fett and his new henchmen where he questions whether hiring a group of youthful misfits was a good idea, before they promise to step up their game in future resulting in Fett giving them one more chance to prove their worth. And slowly, as the series goes on, they do just that, regaining Fett's trust and earning his respect.

Additionally, this can lead to a scene where Fett speaks to one of them - probably the British leader girl - who opens up to him about their past, which is where their backstory can be explained or better yet, shown through flashbacks with narration. This moment of bonding can further be used to highlight Fett's own development - that while he is still a ruthless crimelord, he is willing to hear out his workers instead of just barking orders.

So yes, this isn't much and doesn't fix some of the other major issues with The Book of Boba Fett but it is my attempt at improving one area. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.",1645974362,starwars,0.0

Could these be the same pit droids as Peli Motto's in the mandalorian? The resemblance is pretty close. Wouldn't let me post pics,1645966906,starwars,0.0

With a few charcter changes the sequals could have been an amazing continuance,"**The Force Awakens**

* Ditch Snope. Chancellor Leia leads the New Republic (NR) forces in wiping out what is left of the Imperial Remnant (IR), haunted by the revelations about her father.
* Kylo doesn't have the name change, is still Ben Solo, has a white suit with blue lightsaber and is convinced he is a full Jedi Master. Hux similarly is a NR officer.
* Poe is an Imperial ace, the opening village are IR civvies slauightered by vengeful NR troops.
* Finn is then a NR deserter.
* Rey's storyline basically untouched.
* Ben still talks to vaders helmet ""I am what you should have been"". Force ghost Anakin arguing with Ben, refusing to teach him how to become a force ghost, as this is a power only to be used by the light side.
* Starkiller base is a New Republic weapon of mass destruction, used to destroy IR hold outs and civilian worlds.
* End of the film plays out similarly, but with Han Solo leading an IR force to destroy the base. ""Leia doesnt even realise she has slipped to the dark side. She never had the training Luke did"".
* Han then allows the others to retreat while he tries to hold off Ben. Ben kills Han out of anger that he would side with the Imperials.
* Splitview of Leia and Luke feeling Hans death, Leia shows rage Luke shows sadness and acceptance.

**The Last Jedi**

* IR fleeing towards rumour of a ""last moff"" who is still holding out.
* Rey leaves to find Luke and ask for his help as per release film.
* Cut the cantina and tracking subplot, replace with time of Finn becoming a Stormtrooper (officer with the pauldron identifier) and meeting his new team, more time with Finn &amp; Poe, more time with Rey and Luke. No stormtrooper clones, they are all volunteers from rhe IR worlds defending against a ""NR invasion"". Callbacks to the original rebellion.
* Luke left with the untainted padawans - Rey joins the other padawans and all training together to fight Ben and the padawans who stayed with him - effectively fallen Jedi and a new jedi civil war. Ben and his fallen padawans are still in Lukes academy. **NO SITH!**
* Crait then becomes an IR hold out base, scenes of Finn and Poe setting up an IR defence against NR walkers.
* IR are losing when Ben and his ""Knights of the New Republic"" land.
* Rey comes back with the Mellenium Falcon, Luke, and the mostly trained padawans.
* Projection battle goes pretty much the same, revealed at the end Luke is on the falcon.
* Last moff holdout revealed to be Thrawn.

**The Rise of Skywalker**

Largest amount of changes for obvious reasons.

* Thrawn, Luke, Finn, Poe and Rey are planning how to slip a team onto Coruscant, for Luke to confront Leia.
* More training with Rey and the padawans.
* Thrawn and Poe coordinate a large space battle with remaining star destroyers over coruscant. Callback to opening of episode 3.
* Finn leads a stormtrooper team through the senate and coruscant palace, callbacks to episode 1.
* Ben arguing with force ghost of Anakin. ""Only the light side can become force ghosts"", Ben refuses to accept he could be wrong and that Luke must be a darkside user, ""You think i would teach my son how to do this if he was fallen?"".
* Luke, Rey and the padawans face off against Ben and the fallen padawans (all using lightside clothing and lightsabers still as they still not aware they have really fallen).
* Leia has very shaky control of her force powers. Sometimes shooting lightning with little control of where it goes, sometimes nothing happens.
* Luke confronts Ben, hold up his saber to let Ben kill him (ala episode 4 Kenobi) ""I will not strike you down in anger Ben"". Ben kills Luke, sure that he will just find a body. Luke becomes a force ghost, scene of Kenobi, Anakin, Luke and Yoda as force ghosts looking down at Ben weeping over Lukes robes.
* Rey ""locks"" Leia away from the force with Bens help, she is held by the IR who retreat back into their own space. 
* Film ends with a non-aggresion pact and loose alliance between the NR and IR. Final shots are of Rey and Ben together, training a new class of padawans outside of both IR and NR space, while Leia looks down fondly on them both, standing next to force ghost Luke.",1645952061,starwars,0.5859

If theres one thing I always respected in starwars,"I'm not a big fan or anything, but if there's one thing I always thought was well done, fun for the spectator, made sense, and was also probably entirely unintentional, is..

&amp;#x200B;

...how much \*fun\* Palpatine is having. He's being campy as fuck, laughing maniacally, joking, snearing, smiling, taunting, ... one could say he's probably the only chararacter in the saga having a good time at all in the movies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at him fight Yoda, he's unwinding, letting loose, cackling like a lunatic. And all the fun he's having ?  Its contagious to the viewer. And that is the unintentional power of camp. It works. We cheer for him because he's having a good time. 

&amp;#x200B;

And thematically, it make sense because Sith are really just Force user who let go and ride their emotions.

New Fan Question,"Ashamedly, I now admit that in my mid 30's I have for the first time become a massive fan of Star Wars.

Prior to this, I had only seen the original 3 films from the 70's and 80's. My younger self thought they were ""okay"", but ultimately shrugged it off.

Several months ago i decided to give the original three another try, and I was hooked - line and sinker. Presently, the only content I have left to watch is the 2 or so animated series - which I'll admit I may skip as I generally dislike animated movies/series altogether.

During my recent Fandom, I've obviously been googling shit to help me understand certain topics in the movies/series, and I've come across wookipedia. I've gone down the rabbit hole on that site quit a bit, and have read some really interesting stuff about Star Wars history prior to Phantom Menace.

That is something I would love to learn more about. I have no idea how far back canonicle Star Wars history goes. Is there like a box set of books I can read or something? Looking for recommendations, or interesting bits of information of early known Star Wars history.",1645944780,starwars,0.3182

Calamari Flan exemplifies Disneys laziness in my opinion,"Hey everyone! I've always loved Star Wars and Disney acquiring the IP was disheartening to me. But, I gave Disney a shot and was able to truly enjoy a lot of the Star Wars media created by Disney. However, during my rewatch of The Mandalorian I have been noticing some issues that bug me. One that sticks out is the currency introduced in Mandalorian, Calamari Flan. Honestly it just seems to me like Disney didn't care enough about the details to actually make a cool and unique name, and just slapped 2 foods together. This isn't to say that The Mandalorian is a bad show, I still enjoy it. But details like that just remind me that Disney is focused on profits first and universe development is secondary.

Am I the only one who likes Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka,"The hate kinda baffles me tbh. I don't think I've ever seen so much dislike for a character that went from animation to live action. Fans complain about her look, fighting style, manerisms, voice... They see her as boring, badly acted, not true to the original etc etc.

I honestly thought she was fine in Mando and BoBF. Her acting didn't blow me away or anything like that but I liked seeing the character in live action and I do think she did a fine job with a very limited screen time and mediocre dialogue writting.

So why all the hate for her portrayal? Is it because fans don't think she's a good actress? They don't like the character in general and are sick of her? Or is it simply the case of her not being the right fit for Ahsoka(which is sorta weird since she was fancasted iirc)? Maybe all of the above?",1645926012,starwars,0.4215

The prequels are amazing,"&amp;#x200B;

I would just like to start by saying that this is just my opinion and if you disagree with anything said, that is 100% okay. However, if you are going to disagree please be respectful and constructive. I just finished re-watching the prequels after not seeing them for a long time and the whole time I was watching them all I could think was how great they really are. I absolutely love all three of them with all the story and character development that it presents. I love all the compelling characters (with maybe the exception of Jar Jar, I think we can all agree that he is still pretty bad lol) from Anakin &amp; Padme, Qui-Gon &amp; Obi-Wan, the clones &amp; Jango, and many more. There are so many fantastic moments, excellent visuals, and music it's not hard to see that these films are truly great. Another reason I have grown to appreciate them, even more, is because of Disney's sequels. I do not like those movies, and seeing how bad they are caused me to put the sequels in an even greater light. The prequels are also where we are introduced to one of the best tragic stories of all time; Anakin. Every time I re-watch Anakin's story arc I can't help but feel sad for all the things he went through, all he wanted was to be with Padme, have a family, and bring peace. That is one of the biggest reasons why the prequels are great, they present a story that really makes you feel something. The final reason as to why I love them is because these films (specifically AOTC) led to the show that made my childhood, The Clone Wars. I just wanted to express my love and appreciation for these 3 movies and really the franchise as a whole. Again, this is all my opinion, and feel free to say why you did/didn't like the prequels.",1645897671,starwars,0.5859
Its kind of wild that theres not a lot of canonical content for Jango Fetts life,"Dunno how accurate I am or what people’s thoughts are on this, but I was just thinking Jango must’ve *REALLY* fucked shit up in his life to becoming the domino he embodied in the films. Is there any content or reference right now I could peruse for the stories of how he came upon the mandalorian armor, or how he came upon becoming the model for the clone army of the republic? Or why he asked for a clone of himself for a son instead of having one of his own? Or anything really, he seems incredibly ambitious and important in the big picture Star Wars universe I’d love to see more content. 

P.S. I know the story with the clone army in reference to the “Star Wars: bounty hunter” game, but I don’t know if that’s considered canon under Disney’s guise.",1645897309,starwars,0.0

Happy birthday scotty,"""I cannae change the laws of physics! ...

On this day in 1920 James Montgomery Doohan was born. The Canadian actor, author and soldier, best known for his role in the television and film series Star Trek.

Doohan served in the 14th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. He also served as a pilot. He saw combat in Europe during World War II, including the D-Day invasion of Normandy, in which he was wounded and saved by a silver cigarette case gifted to him by his brother.

But in 1966 He cemented his place in Geekdom and sci-fi history when he brought to the screen Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott, the Engineer aboard the Enterprise in the original series of Star Trek. He would go on to reprise the role in the animated series and later in the Motion picture and its sequels. Doohan during the production of the first film helped create the language of Vulcan and Klingon!

Star Trek has actually become less woke,"This might be a bit of a controversial opinion, but I do believe that “Nu Trek” (meaning The Abrams Movies, Discovery, Picard and Lower Decks), my opinion about their general quality completely aside, are actually less woke than “old Trek” (everything up to including “Enterprise”). 

First things first: I will use woke as a neutrally connotated term.

Yes, excessive marketing and wrong facts (Burnham is allegedly the first black female captain even though there were tons of them before etc.) may try to lead us to believe that this new Star Trek is woke and inclusive and what not. They make such a deal about how diverse and inclusive this new show is, in a way that’s never been done before. However, this is merely a facade. A marketing ploy. Old Trek was more woke than new Trek ever could be. Old Trek, while admittedly occasionally offensive, had people of all genders, sexualities, skin colors etc., even in high/powerful positions. And it did all of this pretending it was the most normal thing in the world. And all of this at a time, where no other media did this sort of thing. Star Trek was always controversial for crossing these “borders” - for going, where no man had gone before.

New Trek on the other hand tries to pretend this all never happened, and Star Trek was some mysogenistic  backwater series before the almighty savior CBS and Paramount. It pretends to make achievements in inclusiveness and wokeness that are not achievements, because they have been done before. New Trek was not the first to do anything concerning inclusiveness. It says it is, but it is not. It didn’t dare cross any taboos of our time, but rather breaks old taboos that have long been broken and tries to make us feel like it’s revolutionary.  

Name me one minority group that was not represented in old Trek and that is in Nu Trek, I dare you. I can’t think of any.

Name one half as controversial topic tackled in Nu Trek that resulted in public outrage. I dare you. 

So, in trying so hard to be woke and making such a big deal about their diverseness, they have actually made Star Trek less woke, rather than more. Which I consider a bad thing. A really bad thing.

___

1x09 - **’Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 1’** 

• Deleted Scenes:

First deleted scene is Soji stalking down the halls of the Artifact, and Ramdha sees her, recognising her as Seb-Cheneb.

Second is A.I. Soong and Sutra discussing not being able to create enough flowers to contend with the incoming romulans, and building beaconl; Soong acknowledges the necessity, and says, with trepidation, that he’s alright with dying. Then he seems to alight on the idea that would save him. Presumably this would then lead into his creating the golem that he was going to transfer himself into. I do like the scene because it implies it wasn’t always Soong’s goal to create a synthetic body for himself --  which makes sense consider how readily he gives it up for Picard -- but I dislike it because he doesn’t really even balk at galaxy wide genocide. His going along with Sutra’s seems less horrible if he’s not aware of the full scope of what will happen if they summon the extra-galactic synthetics.

 • Episode:

I love the Coppelius defense system being giant, spaceborn flowers. It’s such a TOS concept, and the execution is wonderful, especially after Dhaj and Soji’s occasional reference to their fictional father being a botanist.

Seeing the crew come together, working together is nice. Conflict might drive stories forward, but there is definitely something to be said about heartwarming it is to see people cooperating and displaying empathy.

Similar to the orchids, the Coppelian synths, with their togas and abnormal skin tones, are prefect. Their encountering Picard seems almost out of ‘Logan’s Run’ when the citizens of the City of Domes meet the old man.

Isa Briones should turn as Sutra is so subtly different form Soji or Dhaj. It’s really great seeing the two characters on screen, interacting with one another.

A lot of people overreacted to the ocarina-looking synth tool, but that’s silly. The device seems to be an advanced replicator with a neural interface. This is just an extrapolation of extant Star Trek technology, and the fact that Saga didn’t have the context to explain it to Raffi in a way she would understand makes sense given their vastly different life experiences. Much like operating the tool, there are a lot of Trekkies out there who would benefit from using their imagination, even a little bit.

Saga asking Narek for pointers on how Romulans treat their prisoners is a pretty good bit.

Again, the forum at the end of the episode reminds me of TOS. Kirk making an impassioned speech about how the people on the planet of the week need to rise above whatever it is that’s holding them back. Unfortunately in this case there is a more familiar orator whom the naive synths put their faith in.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Probably the discussion following Picard’s reveal to the crew about his terminal brain abnormality. That’s some good Star Trek stuff.  
 • Low Point: Bruce Maddox having a photo of himself and Jurati making out on a loop in his office. That’s weird. Also, more seriously, Soong’s sinister vibe doesn’t mesh with his characterization next episode where he turns on Sutra.  
 • Verdict: I didn’t have a lot ot say about this episode, because ultimately it’s mostly fine. I don’t think it’s as good as ‘Broken Pieces’ or ‘Nepenthe’, but it’s not bad. I remember when I first watched it feeling as though it was a strong foundation for the second instalment, and being pretty hopeful about what would come.

___

1x01 - **’Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2’**

 • Deleted Scene:

In the aftermath of the episode, there’s a montage of Soong, Jurati, Soji, and Picard all looking pensive; Ramdha is showing a pair of the synths the Romulan tarot cards; aboard the La Sirena, Jurati and Rios kiss.

 • Episode:

Narek is a lot more tolerable interacting with the La Sirena crew than at an other point in the series, and I sincerely enjoy more worldbuilding with his recitation of the Gamadan myth.

This is hardly a new observation, but the Romulan fleet and their Federation counterparts are composed of entirely too many ships. The number tips things towards ludicrousness.

So, I want to talk about Mass Effect for a moment. It is, simply put, my favourite video game. And a lot of people upon watching this episode decided that the plot was lifted whole from that game. Synthetic life summoning other synthetics from beyond the galaxy. Pretty similar, of course. However, the story in Mass Effect is not particularly new, and assuming that it was the source for this season of PIC shows an astounding lack of pop culture literacy for science fiction fans. Mass Effect was inspired by Lovecraftian cosmic horror, and I would imagine that ‘Picard’ was as well. Ancient unknowable beings that drive people to madness, the Zhat Vash cult, Narek’s story of Gamadan, the immense tentacles reaching through a tear in space. The difference, of course, between cosmic horror and Trek is that Trek’s foundation is that a better world is possible through hope, and Picard sacrifices himself to demonstrate that hope to Soji.

Unfortunately Picard’s sacrifice and good-bye scene is followed up by completely undermining it, having him transferred to the synthetic body. I have no problem with the idea of Jean-Luc Picard as an android, but the narrative decision to immediately reverse his sacrifice is a complete misfire, only exacerbated by the fact that it’s one scene right after the other. The show is attempting to have it both ways by maintaining it’s big star that will draw in all the Trekkies who want to watch their space dad, but also have this big moving moment where he dies surrounded by the crew who’ve come together during the course of this adventure.

Even worse, the revelation that Data’s mind has existed in this quantum simulation for 20 years, only to kill him off is masturbatory. I think most Trekkies would agree that Data’s death in ‘Nemesis’ was anticlimactic, but trying to “fix” that and give him a proper send-off here requires him to have existed, alone, with no one aware of his continuation for two decades, and that seems torturous. ‘Nemesis’ left the door open for Data’s return, but the show choose to disregard that by emphasizing that B4 simply wasn’t capable of assimilating Data’s mind, and then had this protracted attempting at tugging on our heartstrings.

That said, even though I disagree it’s happening, I can admit the scene between Data and Picard is well done. It is a pleasure to see these two characters again having a conversation, even as I’m annoyed that it is happening.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Picard’s speech to Soji on the open channel.  
 • Low Point: The death scene was overwrought considering it amounts to nothing.  
 • Verdict: A very frustrating episode. I think I may have enjoyed it more on the rewatch, but still full of problems.",1646301665,startrek,0.0
A little observation about Star Trek as it is now,"Firstly, I want to qualify this post by saying I love Discovery. Have since the first episode. The character growth for the crew has been immense and we've followed them through incredible adventures and great adversity.

But...

Am I the only one that thinks its beginning to get a bit *too* touchy-feely?

Don't get me wrong, the emotional impact on some of the characters has been wrenching and the actors have been brilliant at conveying it but, as a die-hard Star Trek fan, I'm beginning to get a bit antsy and just want them to have a mission that *doesn't* involve an anomaly or where the answer doesn't lead to profound self-discovery (pun intended).

My wish for Season 5 is that the Federation, as it is, comes up against a force so mind-boggingly malevolent and technologically advanced that they get their asses handed to them in the first few episodes and it takes the rest of the season just to draw level. Let's see some action. Let's see some dogfighting between fighter craft. Let's see some honest-to-goodness space battles.

Keep the emotion, keep the character growth but ditch some of the drama and ramp up the action.

Or am I the only one?",1646301239,startrek,0.0

Wondering what other series there are with a similar theme and tone to Star Trek that I might enjoy?  
I read a few other post on here of the same pedigree, but I know nothing of most the shows mentioned.   


Kind of looking for a show with a lot of seasons that I could get involved in. I just finished Enterprise and I really enjoyed it, but it ended way too soon. 

Personally, I really enjoyed every series from ToS through Enterprise, but my favorites would probably be DS9 and TNG.   


I guess I could rewatch them, but sort of looking for something new as well if there is anything.

What I'm looking for...   


**- Family Friendly**

Star Trek Picard The Dark Veil Review,"Last week I jumped into a book store and grabbed the first 4 Star Trek Novels that I could find that I hadn't read.

To be honest, I didn't realize that it was **Star Trek Picard** when I grabbed the book and if I had noticed I probably wouldn't have purchased this book. **Thank goodness I didn't realize it!**

# My take on this book:

It feels like what you'd expect to get out of Star Trek post TNG. If you've read any of the Star Trek Titan novels and enjoyed them, this one will be right up your alley! I loved the new featured characters, I loved the new race that was introduced, I loved the motivations that all parties involved had throughout the entirety of this story and I felt that the ending was a believable conclusion. I'd give it an 8/10, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't already fairly familiar with the Star Trek franchise.",1646265894,startrek,0.0
So where do 21st Century Drug SoldiersQs Kangaroo court fall between an atomic holocaust and Zefram Cochrane flying into space,"Watching TNG’s “Encounter at Farpoint”…I am confused on how “going into space” would have even be on the table back in the mid-21st century when Q’s “historically accurate” court looks like a castle from the Dark Ages. Especially after the Eugenics War/World War III (not to be confused with WWIII that was prevented in TOS’s “Assignment: Earth”)! The weapons were advanced sure, but why castles? 

Were these drug soldiers used in 2024 around when Sisko went back in time in DS9’s “Past Tense”? They didn’t have to use medieval torches in San Francisco. Was Malcom Reed’s grandfather a drug soldier when he was in the Royal Navy? Any explanation would be appreciated.",1646265570,startrek,0.0

Just reached Restrospect in my Voyager watch through and its really troubling me,"Although my personal absolute favourite Star Trek series is TNG, I've got a lot of love for Voyager. What's troubling me about this episode apart from the obvious ""you're reporting being violated but (since you can't 100% prove it) we're going to assume you're experiencing fake memories (!) also it's your fault that man died, feel bad"" theme, is contrasting it with TNG. 

If you look at the Remember Me episode of TNG one of the things that strikes you is the level of trust and respect shown to Beverly Crusher. Without any concrete proof of what she was saying, the senior staff took her seriously, listened to her and started investigating on her word alone (obviously you could argue that's for reasons revealed at the end of the episode, but it didn't seem at all out of character).

One of the reasons I love Voyager so much was that when it first came out it was SO important to young me that there was a female captain. So to see a (potential) female assault victim being treated so poorly really upset me. I dont think it meant that much to younger  me when i saw it, but it's really tainted my enjoyment of Voyager. 

Is it one of those product of their time things? Was TNG ever like this and my love for Picard has just blinded me? Or did the Voyager show runners mess this one up?",1646254774,startrek,-0.5256
Vance is the best admiral character in all of Trek,"For most of Trek history, Starfleet admirals have usually been antagonists, and often cartoonish ones at that. DS9 bucked that trend a bit but I think Discovery has knocked it way out of the park with Admiral Vance.

Vance does one thing in particular that really elevates him above the rest for me: he protects his team’s interests while advancing the goals of the organization as a whole. He has one foot in the political arena and one foot in the Starfleet arena, and he finds compromises between the two (or sometimes loopholes) that give the Starfleet side room to maneuver. If I were under his command, I’d trust that he had my back, and I can’t think of any previous Trek admiral that gave me that impression.

Oded Fehr’s restrained performance is just right for the character. He can crank up the intensity when it’s called for, but usually, his demeanor gives off strong “this is the adult in the room” vibes.

I hope he sticks around for the long haul. It’s a pleasure every time he appears on the show.",1646254740,startrek,0.7579
Chekov in untilled Star Trek Four Kelvin,"Excited about another cinematic Star Trek project in the Kelvin timeline?

Me too.

However, with the tragic loss of beloved actor Anton Yelchin, the absence of his character of Chekov will certainly have to be addressed.  I'm interested in the thoughts all of you might have on his the filmmakers will handle it.

I had a thought.  I wondered if, in the tradition of giving TOS actors ""one more ride"" as their character if the Kelvin Chekov might have been involved in a time travel incident wherein he became trapped within the time warp and aged to the point where it would be appropriate for Walter Koenig to portray him in the next installment.

Without something like that happening we would have to face the idea that Chekov was killed offscreen and that the remaining crew would observe some kind of memorial for him at the beginning of the new film.

Star Trek Discovery  does it ever stop being the Burnham show,"There are multiple threads already about whether STD is worth watching or now.. ok, maybe I should use the acronym DISCO? Just using the title letters seems it might incite some mistaken emphasis. 

Anyways, my question is more focused. I saw some episodes when visiting family, and it seems to have potential. What put me off is that it felt like it feels like a fanfic, with Burnham as the self-insert character. Just from the brief parts I see in passing: 

\-Spocks top secret half-human sister who is also adopted and went through trauma at Vulcan, but despite being a sceret is also the only one who can save Spock from insanity, because *reasons*.

\-Apparently becomes a time travelling red goddess figure who receives messages from across time?

\-By delaying cutting off Saru's ganglia due to an inability to harm her friend, instead discovers that they will fall off by themselves after a few minutes and thereby upends thousands of years of knowledge for his people. They just fall off after a matter of minutes, and he couldn't cut them off himself due to pain, but somehow in thousands of years this never happened until Burnham was there to witness it?

\-Declared to be the only one who is worthy of being spoken to by a sentient dying planet.

\-The crew from Captain on down reference/ask about/ask her opinion directly in almost every conversation,  focusing on her like a video game protaganist. Even if if just to make it clear how much of a hero/renegade/saviour/dissapointment of the moment she is being.

\-Perfect (though conflicted) Mary-Sue, check.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things I always enjoyed about Star Trek was that there entire crews at work, with many disciplines in play. In TNG Picard may be the legendary figurehead, but without his crew he would have been lost long ago, and they carry the story as central characters much of the time, not infrequently saving him from his own mistakes &amp; tirals. By contrast, DISCO feels like the Burnham Show, with occasional sidekicks.

___

1x07 - **’Nepenthe’**

 • Episode:

I know I’m not alone in saying this was my favourite episode of the season. As an extremely awkward child, I gravitated towards Data; now as an adult Riker is the character whom I identify with probably more than any other of the TNG crew, so seeing him return here was a big moment for me.

It was, and remains, absolutely buck wild that when Oh gives Jurati the tracking isotope and doesn’t have to tell her it needs to be taken orally. “It must be chewed.” What? No! Even though Oh knows that Jurati needs to ingest the isotope, she should still be aghast that Agnes’ first impulse was to put it in her mouth. This season is actually really good, as it demonstrates a wonderful contrast between the naive and friendly Juarti, and the cold, sinister commodore Oh, but the fact that Agnes immediately goes to swallow this random thing she’s handed is all I can think about.

The casualness with which the Romulans execute the ex-Borg would be interesting if the series choose to give it greater focus. We’ve had Hugh mention a couple times how hated and maligned they are in the galaxy, and Narissa treats them as though they’re disposable. Trash she can simply throw away. Again, seems like a missed opportunity to actually deep dive into the ex-Borg’s place on the galactic-political stage, but the show chooses to treat them as fodder.

Kestra is great. That’s all.

While I was excited about seeing Riker again, the reunion with Troi is much more affecting. Marina Sirtis is able to put such genuine emotion into her performance that it’s impossible for me to watch the pair hug and not mist up a bit.

The silliness of the story Troi tells Soji regarding Thad’s death is a huge stumbling block. Accepting that the Federation would condemn someone to death rather than provide the means of creating a cure is simply a bridge to far. A lot of people have criticized the Federation presented in this series as being dystopic, and I personally think that’s a hyperbolic assessment derived from a very narrow understanding of events, this is the one real piece of evidence where i would say that yes, the Federation has backslid. Worse though is trying to tie Thad’s death into the synth ban at all. It is such a ridiculous contrivance that it never should have made it past a first draft, let alone gotten shot, edited, and broadcast.

I’m annoyed that the showrunners made me actually care about Hugh only to kill him off, but at least it’s not just to motivate Elnor, who is significantly less of a character.

Jurati’s breakdown while they’re attempting to evade Narek seems to come too early in the story. Rios and Raffi clue into the fact that there’s something up with her, and then in the next the next scene with them, it stars seems like Raffi is attempting to find out what specifically the deal is, but it turns out she’s actually just being kind. And I like it when characters are kind to one another, but it’s out of line with the character they’ve created for Raffi. Not because I think she doesn’t have the capacity for kindness, but because her default state is paranoia. Conspiracy. Seeing connections. She was even looking at some of the Romulan ex-Borg’s art that hinted at her Conclave of Eight when Agnes had her breakdown, but didn’t even have an inkling that the two might be related? I have to assume that this is the result of a change in the script that did not retroactively connect back to the earlier motivations, even though it should have.

I want a comic book series about this Rupert Crandall dude Kestra keeps bringing up. This guy sounds like he rules.

Elnor finding Seven’s Fenris Ranger tag in Hugh’s office is another huge contrivance. I remember the first time I watched the episode I was confused because I assumed that it must be the one she gave Picard, so how did it end up here? While it might make sense that Hugh would have the tag, it’s a storytelling misstep, because Picard never uses his, and it’s just too convenient that Hugh not only has one, but Elnor is able to find it. Better if Picard choose to give it to Hugh while he was on the cube. Or if Picard had refused to take it, so Seven handed it to Elnor behind Picard’s back.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: There a lot to love about this episode, but I think Marina Sirtis’ performance is spectacular.  
 • Low Point: Troi’s explanation for Thad’s death.  
 • Verdict: Probably the second best episode of the season. I know I can come across as somewhat negative, but a lot of the time when I pause the episode to make a note, it’s often because something clanged for me. So yeah, despite the majority of my critique here being disparaging of what they’ve done, that’s largely because when episode is good, I’m happily following along.

___

1x08 - **’Broken Pices’**

 • Deleted Scenes:

There are three deleted scenes for this episode. The first is the Trill scientists Soji met in episode two clambering down a corridor aboard the Artifact before encountering an ex-Borg who announces, “We are the Borg,” at which point she scrambles away. No doubt the scene was cut for time, but I think it would have worked in the episode. Would have been nice to see the character again, establishing a continuity.

Second is some unfinished CGI of Borg nano-machines repairing the cube. There’s already at least one scene of that, so cutting the second makes sense.

The third scene is Ramdha waking up in the medical facilities. I’m not sure it adds anything unless there’s another deleted scene following up on Ramdha in a later episode.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • Episode:

I like the flashback to the admonition. There’s a stark brutality to it that helps to but into context the Zhat Vash’s motives, and the scene is shot and edited in a very affecting manner.

Rios having a connection to Soji is another contrivance, though I think by itself it would be fairly forgivable, and it does serve the overall story. Unfortunately it stands out, especially in the binge watch, due to just how many contrivances the series expects the viewer to accept.

Picard talking about Data with Soji is pretty good. I especially like Picard observing that he and Data were similar in their limited capacity to express emotion, and how obviously impactful it is when Soji declares that Data loved him.

Not enough good can be said about Santiago Cabrera’s heavy lift as all the emergency holograms. The different personalities and mannerisms he gives each goes beyond just the accents. Enoch the nav hologram is too chipper, the hospitality holo -- which closed captioning refers to as “Mister Hospitality” and that’s a good bit -- keeps on getting in people’s personal space. Great stuff.

The intercutting between Jurati and Soji, and Rios and Raffi is nicely done. They’re very different conversations, but both are about the characters’ intrinsic humanity.

It’s a bit curious that the ibn Majad would be stricken from Starfleet’s records entirely. Rios covered up what happened, so why would the entire ship be redacted? I suppose Oh might have been overzealous in the follow-through.

This impromptu crew briefing with the mess of the La Sirena standing in for the Enterprise’s briefing room makes me nostalgic for TNG.

Picard and Rios connecting at the end of the episode also works well. and it’s corny, but I enjoy Picard’s assertation that all they need to overcome is optimism and curiosity.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Raffi’s assembly of emergency holograms.  
 • Low Point: Narek’s ship showing up at the very end of the episode. It looked like he was waiting for them in transwarp corridor? How does that work?  
 • Verdict: Two strong episodes in a row. If this was what the entire season was like, I would have a much different opinion of it as a whole.",1646231375,startrek,0.0

Who is the best main character from any series,"As a mirror to another recent post, who is the best main character? Not necessarily your favorite, but from a more objective writing/acting/production standpoint.


My vote would go to Data.

 Non-humans usually provide the best foils for the Federation characters, but Data's Pinnochio syndrome leads him to constantly exploring and seeking to understand the human condition. Sometimes he's used just as a way to get Picard to deliver a philosophical speech, and sometimes he's just big robot man doing robot man things. However, Data also has fascinating backstory episodes, develops a lot as a character over the course of TNG and the movies, and has very wholesome friendships with several other characters. Further, Data himself is the subject of several heavy hitting philosophical episodes that ask very hard questions about life and sentience.

My thoughts on the original movies,"I've been a Star Trek fan for a while but I'm only now getting to the movies and I just finished Undiscovered Country.

Its worth mentioning that I liked all of them, because I like Star Trek in general, but some were definitely better than others.

The Motion Picture: It definitely earned its reputation for being slow but I still thought it was a vibe and I liked the set pieces. The twist at the end was cool too.

Wrath of Khan: It deserves the hype and Ricardo Montalban is a fantastic villain. Not much I can add to this one that hasn't already been said a hundred times.

Search for Spock: I thought Christopher Lloyd made a great Klingon and it was well connected to the previous movie. Otherwise, that's about all I remember.

The Voyage Home: This was my favorite one. It's totally absurd but that's exactly how I like my Sci-Fi. Chekov asking the SFPD officer where the nuclear vessels are with a heavy Russian accent is one of my favorite moments in the whole franchise

The Final Frontier: I understand why this one is considered the worst but I didn't hate it. Spocks half brother trying to contact god was a cool concept but the execution was off.

The Undiscovered Country: When Star Trek does political intrigue it (usually) does it very well, and this was no exception. Chang was awesome and seeing the Khitomer accords was cool after hearing about it so much in TNG and DS9. A great final entry. Makes me wish we got that Captain Sulu series.",1646194646,startrek,0.3182

For reference, I'm 5/7 seasons into TNG and a couple episodes of TOS so my opinion isn't more harsh because I prefer other Star Trek movies. I can't believe how poorly this movie is done, and that it doesn't get universal hate from everybody.



First of all, let's talk about the dead space in this movie. This could've been a good so many minutes shorter if they just took 30 seconds to show the Enterprise or the inside of that Alien thing. Instead they had a crappy cinematic sequence to show them both off for like 10 minutes. The first hour of the movie essentially got nothing accomplished. They brought the band back together and offered absolutely no character development or interesting dynamics. The acting was mediocre at best. Decker has this romantic relationship with the Deltan woman, but there's no emotion involved for the veiwer because they didn't develop that dynamic at all in the movie. The whole thing felt like a normal episode of TOS stretched out to 2 hours. That was such a chore to watch, my GF and I had to watch it piece by piece over 2 days to get it over with.",1646191799,startrek,-0.7269

The Borgs transwarp vs Arturiss quantum slipstream  which is better,"We see both technologies in Voyager.

Then we see the Flyer use transwarp and Janeway then says Voyager used it for a few more hours before the coil failed.

which tech would be the better option? I’m thinking transwarp. It seems more mature than quantum slipstream, and didn’t cause any issues whereas the quantum slipstream would be very dangerous to use long term. Arturis’s ship was clearly designed for it. One advantage slipstream seems to have is its built right into the engine framework, whereas transwarp requires coils that burn themselves out, possibly by design.

1x04 - **’Absolute Candor’**

 • The Episode:

I don’t think I noticed this kind of twangy, space western music that the episode opens with during my first watch. It’s giving me ‘Firefly’ vibes, and maybe this isn’t as much of a hot take as it used to be, but ‘Firefly’ is overrated, and Joss Whedaon has always been overrated.

Pretty sure I mentioned this in my first watch through, but I really wish some of the Romulans we see here on Vashti would have had the mourning tattoos we see the crew of the Narada wearing in ST’09. Not a lot, but one or two in the background would have helped to cement the connection between the evacuation efforts the show is depicting in the flashback, and the destruction of Romulus depicted there.

The term “sisterboy” is a wild thing to include in a Star Trek episode that came out in 2020. Also, Picard wearing plantation owner cosplay when he beams down to the colony is in interesting choice. They might as well have just given the dude a pith helmet.

Introducing the Qowat Milat into canon is great. One of the oft observed issues with Star Trek is how non-Humans tend towards mono-culture. All Klingons are one way, and all Vulcans another. Say what you will about the newer iterations of the franchise, one of the best things they’ve done is diversify all these familiar faces in the galaxy, and as much as I might joke about Romulan nunjas, I am very happy about their inclusion.

“Man can’t even take a guilt trip without a starship,” is an absolute banger of a line. 10/10, no notes.

Santiago Cabrera’s turns as all the holograms aboard La Sirena is wonderful. I really hope that’s an element of the series that survives to the upcoming seasons.

There is something about Narek that sucks all the oxygen out of every scene he’s in. He’s obviously supposed to be enigmatic and mysterious, but the character just comes off as a fuckboy. Watching him slide around the corridor of the Borg cube, I can’t imagine any scenario where he starts talking and every other character in the room doesn’t immediately start checking their PADDs to see the time so they can make an exit.

Nothing like seeing a revamped TOS Romulan BoP to bring the spirits back up. Gorgeous. Sadly, it also makes me wish I was watching ‘Balance of Terror’ instead.

I forgot about Elnor wanting to see a cat. Seems like the kind of thing they set up that would have had a payoff by the end of the season but it never did. Maybe it will come back around in the upcoming seasons.

There’s something about the Romulan thugs walking around with swords on their hips, especially swords that the prop department just grabbed from whatever was available given the basket hilts don’t in any way communicate romulan design, that doesn’t work for me. Obviously the intent here is to invoke the Three Musketeers that Picard was introducing young Elnor to in the flashback, but the question is to what purpose? Like, this former senator is caring a disruptor pistol, so the sword is not a display of strength, and if they wanted the Romulans to have a melee weapon, why not create something distinctly to them. I’m not suggesting they go as far as introduce something as distinct as a bat’leth, but if they’re going to carry swords make them not look like something you’d find in a ‘Pirates of the Caribbean' movie.

Picard going off an Elnor for killing the senator seems like misdirected anger. What did he think was going to happen when he asked a dude who group up in an order of warriors whose primary mode of problem solving is sword?

Fuckin’ jeepers, the only thing worse than Narek is Narek and Narissa together. We get it, she’s creepy. They do mention the possibility of Soji “activating” though, which was is a term I didn’t think got used outside the pilot episode, so apparently I was wrong.

Chopping up the BoP seems like a personal affront. I’ll get over it though, because no doubt the only reason they didn’t actually just destroy it, and made such a big deal about this Kar Kantar warlord is that he’s going to return later in the season with the ship repaired, looking to exact revenge, right? Oh, that doesn’t happen. Guess we’re just leaving every one of Chekhov’s guns on the shelf.

The first time I watched this episode, I saw Jeri Ryan’s name in the credits, but forgot by the time Seven actually appears at the end. It is still funny to me how hard they go trying to misdirect the audience by referring to the pilot of the unknown ship with male pronouns only for Seven to be the one to beam aboard at the end. “What, a woman? Gasp!”

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: I joke, but the fight between La Sirena and the BoP is great, and I especially enjoy the introduction of the Emmet the Emergency Tactical Hologram.  
 • Low Point: I don’t think I could overstate at this point how detrimental Narek being on screen is to my enjoyment of this episode.  
 • Verdict: Meh! There’s a lot of peaks and valleys here. Once again, I wish we were in the story of the flashback at the beginning of the episode as opposed to the present being told. Even though I think there are some misses, I really enjoy and appreciate world building out the Romulans, and the introduction of the Qowat Milat. On the other hand, Elnor might as well be one of the non-sentient worker synths for all the personality he has. Every time we visit the Artifact it is a struggle to pay attention to the screen, but getting the battle with the BoP at the end is like a delicious treat. All in all, probably my least favourite episode of the rewatch so far.

1x05 **’Stardust City Rag’**

 • Episode:

Before I even press play, I’m looking forward to this one, because I remember it being one of my favourite episodes of the season. I know that’s not exactly a popular opinion, but I’ve always enjoyed what I consider the fun ones; ‘A Piece of the Action’ is like a top three TOS episode as far as I’m concerned, and I love the Ferengi episodes of DS9. Except ‘Profit and Lace’ which started bad and did not age well.

I really hate killing off an established character to motivate another for revenge. Like, even someone like Icheb -- whom I refuse to believe has any actual fans, because what is there to be a fan of? -- I would rather just not have show up than have them get killed on screen. It just seems cheap. In the past I’ve gotten into arguments with people claiming it’s necessary to establish stakes or bring other characters together, but it really shouldn’t be. Getting ahead of myself here, but what does Icheb’s death actually add to the story? Seven wants vengeance against Bjayzl, but it is established that Seven is already a member of the Fenris Rangers during the flashback, so she’s already motivated to take down the crime boss destabilizing the region and dealing in black market Borg bits. Keep the stuff about how she and Bjayzl had a relationship but Bjayzl betrayed Seven for personal gain. That works. Killing Icheb only adds motivation for Seven to murder Bjayzl at the end of the episode, and I would argue that part of the episode does not work.

All that aside, “Where’s your cortical node, buddy?” is both funny, and a good callback.

Necar Zadegan looks so much like Mirina Sirtis to me that it is distracting.

The holographic pop-up ads for the crew is a fun bit, especially Elnor’s disappointment that he didn’t get one, though Raffi’s Orion drug dealer wearing tie-dye is bizarre. Obviously it’s short hand for the sake of the audience, but in the context of the show does it have any possible resonance with the characters? Also, I really want to know what Seven’s advert was for.

Always love a good heist planning session intercut with the actual operation. Classic, and done particularly well here. Of course, Jonathan Frakes directed this episode, so I’m not surprised that I like the construction.

The scene with Raffi and her son is heartbreaking. There have been a few interviews with Michelle Hurd where she spoke about how she was interested in the role of Raffi because she wanted the opportunity to portray how someone who is broken, whom society would prefer to discard, is still able to contribute. I think she does an amazing job, and this scene the genuine hurt coming from Raffi is palpable. 

Rios sure does have a lot of guns for someone who presumably does mostly cargo transport.

I really appreciate the brief conversation Seven and Picard have about their humanity as ex-Borg, but then the episode flips that table by having Seven beam back down to do the murders she was just talked out of comitting, and it doesn’t work. The episode wants to have it both ways, and it simply cannot.

Unlike Icheb’s flashback death, Maddox’s death does work because it’s done to progress the story, and not provide some flimsy motivation for another character.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Michelle Hurd is great this entire episode. And I have to give an honourable mention to the fact that there was no time spent on the Artifact.  
 • Low Point: Not only do I think having Seven beam back down to Freecloud clangs tonally, her wield two phaser rifles one handed and gunning down various goons like the Punisher is action movie schlock.  
 • Verdict: I’ve already said that I’m rather positively disposed towards this episode, though the rewatch has made me realise that I was focusing on the good and ignoring the things that don’t work for me. I still like it, but I don’t think it’s as good as ‘The End is the Beginning’ or ‘Napenthe’.

1x06 - **’The Impossible Box’**

 • Episode:

One of the…frustrating things about Star Trek is that the creators recognise the need for mental health care -- there are ship’s consulars, and psychiatrists serving aboard ship  going all the way back to ‘Where No Man Has Gone Before’ -- but also find it necessary for characters to insist they don’t need help dealing with their trauma. It happens so much LDecks made a joke about it. And here we have Picard blowing up at Agnes regarding the ex-Borg, when he himself is one, and we just had the scene between him and Seven last episode. In ‘I, Borg’ he was still dealing with that trauma, but was able to recognise Hugh’s humanity, then in ‘First Contact’ he’s giving orders to kill former officers because it would be doing them a favour. For a show that recognises how much Picard developed over TNG, learning to accept and even like kids, learning to be able to be open with his crew, the fact that he’s still having breakdowns about the Borg seems like a missed opportunity.

So, in one of his instagram Q&amp;As, Michael Chabon claimed that it was intended that Raffi and Captain Emmy were supposed to have had a romantic relationship in the past. If that’s the case, it really does not come across in the scene where Raffi puts in the call for a favour. Their dialogue might be kind of flirty, but that’s it. The fact that Raffi burns another bridge with her old life for Picard’s mission is rough, and for him to have the audacity to applaud her after the fact…. My biggest take away from this season is I just want Raffi to be okay and have a good life.

Isa Briones’ scene where Soji is scanning her room and it keeps giving her the same result works really well. It’s unfortunate that the character is paired with Narek so often, because his fuckboy energy really obscures how good she is.

Hugh and Picard’s hug is so palpable. Hugh works so much better as an ex-Borg than he ever did as a Borg, but I suppose without the one we wouldn’t get the other.

“Appearance: Human. From Earth.” It’s very funny to me that Picard is using that as his description for Soji when other than the Borg bits, Hugh himself -- and many other Trek species -- looks indistinguishable from Human, despite the fact that he very likely is not.

Picard’s shift form shouting, “The Borg don’t change, they metastasize,’ at Agnes to, “You’re showing what the Borg are; they’re victims,” in a single episode is a wild swing, especially seeing as this is something he should have come to terms with literally decades ago. If Picard is supposed too be the audience’s window into this story, as we have to assume he is based on the fac that it’s his name on the show, then he really should have a more consistent characterization. Now, they could play his mood swings off as a result of the abnormality in his brain, but they don’t, and if they did it would need to be addressed.

As much as I dislike Narek, the Romulan mediation scene is pretty good. More Romulan world-building is always welcome, and the interplay between the dream and Narek’s guiding Soji works really well. His betrayal feels like actual progress in the story, and I do like Soji tearing her way through the floor to escape the radiation.

Fleeing through the cube to the Queen Cell is pretty good, and I like the fact that Elnor finally gets the opportunity to do something. However, there’s something extremely corny about ending the episode with him asking the pursuers to choose to live. Obviously it’s already been established as a Qowat Milat thing, and his calling card in the series, but I couldn’t help but chuckle and it kind of ruined the tension of the cliffhanger.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Hugh and Picard’s reunion.  
 • Low Point: Narissa and Narek’s scene near the beginning of the episode not only is a Narissa and Narek scene, but the metaphor of opening the Romulibik’s Cube is terribly on the nose.  
 • Verdict: Another mixed bag. There’s enough good moments to string the episode along, but nothing is great, and the two scenes with Picard’s views on the Borg might as well have been written by different people.",1646138803,startrek,0.0
I watched all the TNG movies over the course of February,"I watched all the TOS movies recently, and I made a post on that which I’ll link in the comments, so I thought I’d do the same for the TNG movies. 

Brief reviews and ratings: 
(I should preface this by saying that TNG is my least favourite of all the Trek shows, even the modern ones, despite it being my first. I don’t know why, I’ve just never connected with the crew of the Enterprise D-F as much as I have with the casts of all the other shows)

GENERATIONS (6/10): This was... perfectly alright. The first 15 minutes were good but then it just goes from good to “okay”. Robert and René’s deaths felt completely unnecessary and unearned. I don’t like what they did with Kirk (trapping him in the Nexus for so many years and then bringing him back just to kill him), but I’m not mad about it, he went out saving the Galaxy. The scenes with Kirk and Picard in the Nexus were legendary though, the whole movie was worth it just for those scenes. And Data with the emotion chip was hilarious. I have the “life forms” scene saved on my phone. 

FIRST CONTACT (9/10): What a good fucking movie. So much fun. I didn’t like the weirdly sexual stuff with the Borg Queen but apart from that, amazing stuff. This is the most compelling Picard has been since Family, in my opinion. If I had to choose a Trek movie to rewatch, it would be either this, Voyage Home, or Undiscovered Country. I also loved the cameo from the EMH and Ethan Phillips. 

INSURRECTION (5/10): Again, this was perfectly “alright”. It just felt like an extended TNG episode. 

NEMESIS (3/10): What the hell happened here? The first half of the movie was okay, even interesting, but then the second half just... ugh. The stuff with Troi was awful, Tom Hardy was totally wasted (and acted pretty badly), and I could complain but let’s not waste the whole post on it. The wedding scene and Janeway’s cameo were the best parts. 

That’s it. Some thoughts:
Pretty much all the movies felt like they could be two-part TNG episodes. I think they really failed to do meaningful characterwork like the TOS movies did apart from in First Contact. 

I also didn’t like how all the movies were basically Picard and Data centred. The TOS movies were also heavily centred on Kirk and Spock but that status quo was carried over from the show, whereas in TNG it properly focused on the rest of the ensemble cast, which doesn’t carry over to the the movies. Yeah, Troi and Riker get married, but apart from that they, and the other cast members, feel like set dressing while Picard and Data get all the interesting stuff (and even that interesting stuff isn’t that good, it felt like they were just retreading old ground)

Also, glad to see the Voyager cast getting a lot of love but where are my boys and girls from DS9? Come on. 

Now I’m gonna go and try to finish Picard in time to catch at least episode 2 or 3 of season 2. I’ll probably watch the Kelvin movies... at some point. See you all then?",1646129121,startrek,0.0

Picard Ep 1 shows the Klingon High Council,"When introducing the interview with the Federation News Network, they have a little reel showing stills of Jean-Luc being amazing. One of them, which was noting his skills in diplomacy, is a scene from Sins of the Father, TNG 3.17. Picard wasn’t negotiating for the Federation in this episode, but that’s beside the point of this post. 

The angle of the still shows that the camera would be to the right and slightly below K’mpec, which is a generic klingon. He does not bare any emblems of any specific house that I can see. The Klingon to the left of K’mpec does have two emblems, which might lead me to believe this is indeed K’mpec’s personal guard or advisor. His right hand, so to speak. 

So how did a photo taken by K’mpec’s cohort get into the hands of the FNN? I invite speculation and theory.

Question for Zoomers Does Star Trek still inspire people to want to be engineers and Physicists,"As somebody that had Sci-Fi make want me to want to be an engineer, but things didn't turn out that way due to personal issues, I'm curious if it still does that for zoomers especially if they never seen pre-abrams Star Trek.


It's mostly older star trek that makes me turn engineering gears in my head.


Dr. Phlox's sick bay having something that looks like like ""alien homeopathy"" on the surface makes sense because a lot of modern medicine is derived from nature, (Penicillin is a bread mold, imagine Alien Penicillin) Enterprise still using CFL LCDs makes sense because there were probably printed books on the subject and it would make sense OLED is mostly stored on Hard Drives that could be EMP'd if WWIII ever breaks out, Voyager's Bio Gel is a Wetware Computer, TNG's Iso-linear circuits sound like Application specific glue logic even TOS' Analog Futurism makes me think how Transporters were inspired by Analog Holography and recording an interference pattern and decoding it back to an image and the 23rd century being analog might make sense if you want to quarantine a computer virus.

The unStar Trek Star Trek shows I want to see,"Star Trek: The Romulan War:

Basically season 5 to 7 of Star Trek: Enterprise, but I want it to be like how the Dominion War was portrayed in DS9, but probably even darker. This is the most ‘Star Trek’ like of the shows I am proposing, but it does stray a lot from its message as it's really a show about war. 

Star Trek: Gary Seven:

This is basically what “Assignment: Earth” was setting up. I want this show to be about Gary Seven, Roberta Lincoln and Isis and their adventures in the 20th and early 21st century, adapting elements from Beta Canon. The show’s only connection to Star Trek as a whole is that it’s set in the same universe. Tonally, it could be very ‘un-Star Trek’ like and is more like an action spy show than anything. 

Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars

Could cross over with Gary Seven. This show is basically an adaptation of The Eugenics Wars novels by Greg Cox, where The Eugenics Wars are a series of secret wars or events that are covered up as real-world events in the 1990s. 

Star Trek: World War 3

Star Trek criticism should be discussed not banned,"We all love Star Trek. And one of the things that sets Star Trek apart from other sci-fi franchises is its optimistic view of the future. That said, Start Trek, as produced by modern day humans, is *not* perfect. By that, I mean aspects of production design, character dialogue, conceptual continuity, etc.

Need Help With An OC,"&amp;#x200B;

 \*I'm sorry for the redunancy; I had done something like this months ago but I wasn't able to do a Poll then. \*

This OC is for ""Star Trek: TOS"". As I ship Uhura and Scotty, I've been coming up with a story where they married and had a daughter during the end of the 5-Year-Mission. Though I keep calling her ""Penda"" as that means ""Beloved"" in Swahili, it was Uhura's names before the canon settled with ""Nyota"", and the name could also go with Scotty's heritage due to the figure, King Penda.

However, I can't help but think of other options:

\-Dela: translates as ""to be complete or satisfied"" in Zulu. Which could go with how lonely how Scotty and Uhura were during the show until they got together. Not to mention I'm a sucker for the late Johnny Clegg's song.

\-Dalia: ""Gentle"" in Swahili.

\-Aida: ""Reward"" in Swahili. Got this from the Tim Rice musical.

\-Crystal: As this OC would be born on the Enterprise, Scotty would suggest this after the dilithium crystals (the ship's fuel).

\-Samara: Was another name option for Uhura before ""Nyota"". Means ""Guardian"" or ""Protected by God"" in Hebrew or Arab.

The dominion war saw incompetence on display by both sides,The dominion sent their ships into the alpha quadrant over a period of six months.  If they just sent the three thousand ships through in the first wave the federation woujdn't have been able to stop them.  The federation was incompetent when they abandoned deep space nine.  Destroying dominion ship yards wouldn't mean much if the dominion brought down the mine field and brought reinforcements from the gamma quadrant.  Incompence was also on display during the battle to re take deep space nine.  Federation ships are probably faster then dominion and cardassian ships.  They could have sent their fastest ships to fly right by the enemy fleet and head straight for deep space nine.  Also the federation should have mined the entrance to the wormhole after the first wave of dominion ships came through.  Fifty ships is not enough to wage war against a major power.  The rest of the war also saw a lot of incompetence from both sides.  So why is it that they can't make a war story without making both sides look incompetent.   Star wars also has this problem.

Picard season one binge rewatch  Chapter One,"I wanted to rewatch season one of ‘Picard’ before season two begins, but I overall I did not actually enjoy season one, so I’ve been putting it off. So, let’s take the cellophane off the blu ray that I received as a Christmas gift 14 months ago and do a binge watch!

___

**‘Remembrance’**

 • Deleted Scene:  

The blu ray has a deleted scene for this episode featuring Picard using his spyglass cane, and catching one of the Human workers in the vineyard mocking the Romulans by pantomiming pointed ears with his hands. Laris also sees the worker and looks hurt by his mockery. Picard threatens to sack the labourer and everyone else involved in the mockery.

It’s an interesting scene, though one I’m glad was cut. The ever present question of just how labour works in the future of the 24th century remains. While I am firmly in the camp that believes money exists in Star Trek even while wealth is not a driving concern, it is still tonally jarring to portray Picard as a patrician land holder, lording over the labourers working his vineyard. And, while obviously there are still examples of anti-alien prejudice throughout Star Trek, here it clangs and I don’t think serves to fit the story they’re telling.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • Commentary Track:

This is one of two episodes in the season to have a commentary track. Normally I love this feature in television and movies, but I have seen it implemented so poorly as it is here.

First off, there are five people on the track: Kurtzman, Goldsman, Chabon, Beyers, and Culpepper. That’s a bunch, but not really a problem in and of itself. The issue is that they recorded these commentaries remotely during the pandemic, and decided to implement the video recordings into the episode, so at times when someone is speaking, the episode itself will minimize and instead we’ll get a webcam view of Akiva Goldsman’s bedroom as he talks about the logistical difficulties putting the episode together. Also, when I listen to a commentary track, I like to put on the subtitles for the episode so I can still follow along what’s happening on screen while the commentary talks over top of the show. However, turning on the subtitles with the commentary ended up showing subtitles for the commentary. There are subtitles for the episode itself, but no way that I can find to access that while the commentary is active.

Absolutely terrible execution, making difficult to follow along on the episode because the picture keeps getting minimized, and the audio is being supplanted by the commentary with no easy means of knowing what’s being said by the characters at any given moment.

The commentary itself isn’t particularly interesting or worthwhile; there’s a few interesting facts about making the episode, and a whole lot of back patting for having made it.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • The Episode:
	
I still love this opening dream sequence in Ten Forward, even with Data looking like he’s on the tail end of a month long bender. Ultimately the season is as much about Data as it is Picard, and this scene really sets the tone.

One of the things learned from the commentary track is that the scene in Dahj’s apartment was filmed after the rest of the episode, and wasn’t in the original script. Originally she was just supposed to appear at Château Picard, but it didn’t work as well as they’d thought, and I think that instinct was good.

Rewatching this episode for the first time since it aired, one of the things that stood out to me is the Tal Shiar baddies start yelling “She’s activating” right before Dhaj kicks the tar out of them, and I’m fairly certain that term isn’t used regarding the synths at any later point in the season. It makes me wonder if there was a dropped plot at some point where more than just Dahj and Soji had been sent out into the galaxy, and the Tal Shiar had encountered other synths that went through this process. Or maybe it was just decided in the moment it was a cool thing for them to say?

I really wish we knew more about the interviewer, and why she was the one Picard or Laris and Zhaban choose for the occasion. Surely she was vetted before the fact; the scene only makes sense if Richter has a reputation for good journalism and she wasn’t interested in doing a puff piece for Picard’s ego.

Dhaj arriving at Château Picard and then disappearing in the morning is so much treading water. This is poor pacing.

The fight scene leading up to Dhaj’s death is a lot of fun. TNG would occasionally hint at just how scary Data could be; we see how strong he is, and in episodes like ‘A Fistful of Datas’ it’s mentioned how fast and accurate he is. Seeing those abilities realised with modern effects is neat.

I really like Allison Pill as Agnes Jurati, but something is off about the trip to Daystrom. A lot of it is exposition for the sake of the audience, but I feel like they could have used this opportunity to better explore some specific points. First, that the synths we later see on Mars are unequivocally not sentient. Jurati says that the research is still no where near making a fully sentient synthetic, but I would like for it to have been even more explicit, because apparently that was not enough for some viewers. Second, they keep talking about how unique Data was, completely glossing over Noonian Soong’s other successes such as Lore and Juliana Tainer. They also keep dancing around any mention of Lal by talking about how Data always wanted a daughter.

I know the fear was that too much exposition would be overwhelming for new viewers, but for those of us familiar with TNG, the lack of any mention of Lore in this story is a huge sore thumb. By allowing that fear of alienating the audience less familiar with the source material to dictate what was included in the story, I can’t help but feel as though they were operating with one hand tied behind their collective back, so to speak. Either have a story which goes all in on revisiting these topics and trust that your audience is smart enough to follow along, or don’t rely on the past so heavily, but this half-measure serves no one.

The final scene of the episode starts off great. Narek seems genuinely threatening for about ten seconds, then he starts talking. One of the things he mentions is having had a brother that passed, and at this point it seems like an important plot point which is going to be mentioned again in the future, but with the power of hindsight we know this brother is never mentioned again. Maybe it’s just a lie to ingratiate himself with Soji, but it feels like one of many dangling plot threads that suffuse this season.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Any time Laris is on screen.  
 • Low Point: The bafflingly implemented commentary track.  
 • Verdict: I did, and still do, like the episode, though with the hindsight afforded by having seen the entire season, it is clear that a lot of the problems I eventually came to have with show began here.

**”Maps and Legends’**

 • Episode:

I recently saw some concept art for the Wallenberg-class tugs introduced at the start of the episode where it had a saucer section which made it more closely resemble the Starship boats with which we’re familiar, and while normally I am pro saucer section, I think that if form is to follow function this makes a lot of sense. A tugboat doesn’t need to have extensive living quarters or science labs, or anything else that most Federation ships we see store in the saucer. Room for a small crew and some big engines and it’s good to go. It also makes sense that if the Federation is dedicating itself to rolling these off the assembly line they’d go with a form factor that uses fewer resources, and not having to produce all the tritanium for a saucer shaped hull probably makes a lot of sense. I like it.

What I don’t like is the fact that all these ships are assembled at Mars. This is a nitpick for sure, but the Federation has committed itself to evacuate 900 million Romulans. A lot of these ships look ready to go, so why are they not going? The one thing we know about the Romulans is that as a culture they are paranoid, so I can’t imagine that suddenly having a fleet of hundreds of Starfleet ships, even rescue ships, arrive in their skies all at once would not incite further panic. We know Picard is out there in the USS Verity already relocating folks, so if why are these tugs just chilling in orbit? Probably some logistical issue, but it’s never made explicitly clear.

Anyways, moving past the first 30 seconds of the episode….

I’m curious about what the intent was with Picard’s doctor friend. It’s established here that they served on the Stargazer together, but his tone just seems so off. Like, I get that he’s concerned about Picard given the brain abnormality, but he comes off as almost frightened.

Also, having a the brain abnormality return as a callback to all good things is fine, but I feel like the way it’s used throughout this season really drops the ball, but that’s getting ahead of myself.

I don’t care what anyone thinks, Admiral Clancy rules. For Picard to just roll into her office, completely full of himself, expecting to be reinstated, given a ship and crew, and offering nothing in return but to deign to be demoted to captain, after having just gone on the Federation news and badmouthing Starfleet, Clancy is right to call him out on it. And we see later that she’s not unreasonable. When Picard provides actual evidence as opposed to what must sound like wild theories, she immediately sends help. I liked Clancy when I first saw the episode, and Iike her even more now. The fact that I recently learned Ann Magnuson was in a glam metal band called Vulcan Death Grip doesn’t hurt, either.

“The Federation does not get to decide if a species lives or dies.” This line has never sat right with me. We’ve seen Picard argue on more than one occasion that the Prime Directive dictates that the Federation should allow a species to die if they don’t meet some arbitrary technological benchmark. And while his views on the subject may have changed over the years, the dialogue here does not acknowledge that in any way. It makes this bit of the exchange clang for me, and I wish they’d found a better way for Picard to communicate his position here.

This sarcastic Romulan overseer guy is great. He should have had a larger role to play in the season.

I’d like to see the character bible’s notes for Narissa. Does it just read, “Romulan Cersi Lannister?” Like, I’m not entirely opposed to the character’s whole vibe, except the weird relationship between her and Narek seems out of left field for a Star Trek story. In these early episodes I was able to rationalize it away as Zhat Vash agents must all simply refer to one another as siblings, but then they make it clear later in the season that nope, they’re just brother and sister. Seems like a cheap way to make Narissa come off as more despicable.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Clancy chewing out Picard. Great stuff.  
 • Low Point: It is a fight to pay attention whenever the episode ventures to the Artifact. I’m glad they didn’t try to mystery box it by having the audience learn at the same time Picard does that Soji is on a Borg cube, but man do I wish I cared about anything that happens on the cube.  
 • Verdict: Feels a lot like moving all the pieces into place, but to strain that analogy a bit, just like if setting up a board game takes to long it can dampen the fun of actually getting into the game, I feel like there’s not enough actually happening here. ‘Lost and Found’, and ‘The End is the Beginning’ were originally one episode which ended up being split in two due to running over time, and maybe that was the wrong decision. Sometimes less is more.

**’The End is the Beginning’**

 • Episode:

So, right off the hop, I want to nitpick and Picard’s statement that, “all synthetic lifeforms are banned throughout the Federation immediately.” “Lifeform” would seem to be a misnomer here, because we know that A500 androids that were used on Mars were not, “alive.” Not in the same way that Data was, or Soji is. Obviously the fear here on the part of the Federation is that a non-sapient artificial intelligence would spontaneously develop sapience in the same way that the Exocomps or Moriarty did, but I feel like not using clear terminology is obfuscating the intent that the show is trying too communicate to the audience.

Unfortunately the synth ban is one of the flimiser aspects of this season, and it’s foundational to it. Watching it again with the hindsight of having already seen the entire season just makes it more frustrating.

Raffi says that there are billions of people in what will be the burst radius of the supernova, and I wish the episode gave more specific numbers. We know the Federation was committed to evacuating 900 million, but billions implies at least double that, and likely a great deal more. So what other evacuation effort was there? How many people were the Romulans able to evacuate themselves? What was the Federation plan for non-Romulans in the blast radius? Obviously these sorts of logistical issues of the evacuation aren’t something the show choose to explore with any depth, but that sort of thing would be very interesting to me.

Watching this opening scene really makes think of the show that might have been. A season that was actually about the Romulan evacuation, and subsequent refugee crisis. Perhaps that would be less ambitious, but it’s what I wanted when we first learned that the show would confirm that the Romulan supernova was still prime continuity. Ah, well.

A connection that I missed in my first watch is that here Soji claims before she was assimilated, Ramdha was the foremost expert on ancient Romulan myth, and at the end of the season Narek, her nephew, gives an exposition dump on those same myths to the La Sirena crew. Presumably he learned a lot of what he knows from his aunt. That’s pretty good.

I will admit that I was not excited to see Hugh return. While some people claim that ‘First Contact’ was where the Borg became toothless, and others believe it was VOY, I’m firmly of the opinion that every Borg appearance from ‘I, Borg’ onward weakens the concept. But by the end of this season Hugh was one of my favourite characters.

Picard meeting Rios while he has a bit of shrapnel sticking out of his shoulder is all very dramatic and makes him look like a badass, but what if it’s staged to give a potential client, Picard, the impression that he’s a badass? Because otherwise this bit is just silly.

The scene of the Tal Shiar death squad attacking the Château is great. I love the fact that Laris and Zhaban have squirreled away so many weapons just in their living quarters. You can take the girl out of the ultra paranoid state secret police, so on and so forth.

When I was a kid watching TOS and TNG the Romulans were my favourite adversary for the Starfleets -- mostly because I thought the BoP looked cooler than the Klingon D7 -- and despite all its flaws, I really love how PIC has expanded on them as a culture. There are some weird bits, like Laris’ claim that they have no artificial intelligence, but all the stuff in this episode with the false front door and Ramdha’s breakdown is really neat.

&amp;nbsp;  
 • High Point: Definitely the fight at Château Picard.  
 • Low Point: Where was Number One during the fight at the Château? Why ~~was I~~ were we the audience denied seeing a very good boy tackle some Tal Shiar goon? Unwatchable.
 • Verdict: Of what I would consider to be the opening chapter of the season, this is pretty easily my favourite episode. The internal pacing is strong, and it gets the overall plot in motion.",1646043557,startrek,0.0

The other designs TOS, TNG, Discovery just seems too fantastical to be real.

And if that little module is the drive, where is the fuel? A canister of spores is bigger than the new drive, and Discovery fills the canister from a giant cargo bay that serves as a spore farm. That can't be miniaturized and there doesn't seem to be a farm on Book's ship. They could just use storage and no farm like the Glenn did, but then they'd be limited to a certain amount of jumps before refueling at a planet with mycelium.

I totally get why people might have been annoyed at the time, especially since it basically sank franchise, but it’s just a really entertaining movie. The spaceship battle at the end is really exciting, if not a bit nonsensical and slightly un-TNG, the Reman’s are really fun and distinct Star Trek baddies, the villain being a young Picard clone and Picard having already been established as bastard when he was younger, a lot of fun!

Parallels I see between American History of Expansion and FederationUnited Earth History,"Note: take everything with a grain of salt, not a historian by any means. Also don't want to say that the Federation commited the same humanitarian crimes that Americans have during their expansion. 

Star Trek Enterprise Era 

The Formation of Federation. It's very similar to the formation of The United States, while there's not exactly a revolutionary war, in size the federation is still quite small. Just like the 13 colonies that would become states. 

Star Trek TOS Era

From watching TOS (only TOS) I get this sense that this was the frontiersmen era, so this would be America post Mexican American war, where it has a lot of land but they haven't quite colonized it yet, which is why the Federation is so agressive and protective of it's land (not exactly applies to United States in this case). 

The ""Lost"" Era 

The Lost Era including the movie era I feel like has the strongest parallel to American expansion, as in this era the Federation grows a lot, but also seems to populate many worlds, while also in some ways manifesting destiny. The Federation in this mostly peaceful expansion (which is not exactly true for America tbh) becomes a bit blind to threats due to its version of manifest destiny imo. It's version of manifest destiny being just expanding via economic, technological and political treaties. 

TNG/DS9 Era

At this point the expansion of the Federation has ended. The TNG series and DS9 are the lead up to the Dominion war which parallels the first world war in some ways. At the end of first world war, the Federation remains as the lone superpower much like America in the 20's in some ways.",1645943759,startrek,0.0
I just started the show and why does nobody talk about this episode,"
So I just started watching tng a few days ago and I started at season 3 and i really fell in love with “the ensigns of command” for its incredibly high stakes and smart writing.  That episode hooked me but the next couple weren’t doing the same thing for me so I was like oh no did I speak to soon.  Then here comes the bonding, where do I start with this episode, I have never been so excited by a tv show, it is so unique (I’m speaking broadly I don’t know about in the star trek universe) and so emotionally potent!  The idea that the people on the enterprise are always putting themselves and families in danger and the kids can’t truly decide if they want that or not, the fact that the death of Marla aster affects everyone in unique and profound ways, how the kid is having to handle death and try and deal with it at such a young age, Troy’s careful and gentle approach to helping the kid verses warfs harsh and brash but loving way of helping him, to the aliens motives (which we never see in any show about aliens) and how it just can’t understand human emotion.

Will Picard Retcon out WW3,"I haven't seen the first season, I don't have a Paramount+ account and can't afford one right now, I will watch it when I can afford to. (I have to say this because my lack of knowledge may be relevant)

I've seen the Picard season 2 trailer. At least part of it will take place in 2024.

Star Trek, like Doctor Who, Babylon 5, etc, has had a bad track record of predicting late 20th and early 21st century history. It has been firmly established that there was a eugenics war, a nuclear war, and we will have the technology to launch a spacecraft with artificial gravity and suspended animation beds (I'm not sure what to call them) (TOS Space Seed) by the end of the war.These establishments are retcons as TOS said these wars took place in the 90's.

As real time as moved forward the Eugenics Wars and WW3 has been pushed back to keep to keep the shows and films as our future. Given Star Trek will continue to exist into the foreseeable future and probably for the next thousand years (when there will be the 57th reboot) they will continue to push the events back.

Season 2 will involve Q and maybe the borg, given how powerful such beings are they could rewrite history in a way that could allow Star Trek cannon to remain while getting rid of WW3, allowing the cannon to remain in the future with out making the series alternate history.",1645833900,startrek,0.0

Help me understand why Trill are used as a transallegory,"In the recent history (of which a time span is too vague for me to recall well), I have seen so many articles written from either an anecdotal or sociopolitical perspective about the relationship of the Trill experience, particularly that of Dax, as a means of relating to a trans-identity or trans-life experience. I've had a hard time digesting this, perhaps coming from the perspective of someone who is firmly cis-gender and knowing the trans-community in a largely professional and impersonal capacity. So I'm posting this not to challenge the idea that the Dax story or Trills as a whole are relevant to the discussion of the transgender experience, but rather to try and get some more direct perspective when reading articles that discuss this feel a bit preachy at worst, and speaking to one's own community at best.

From my perspective, when I think about how the Dax story relates to the trans-community, my mind goes to how the symbiont is genderless. They establish pretty early on in DS9 that each blended being is their own identity, so from that perspective I've seen the idea of going from Curzon Dax to Jadzia Dax, for example, as less about changing one's gender identity than it is analogous to carrying on a legacy through oral history. Jadzia was never Curzon, Jadzia only has the memories of Curzon. Indeed, the division between hosts is made even deeper when Jadzia and Ezri had experiences communicating with the remnants of their past hosts living on in Dax's memory. In that sense, it seems very logical that the symbiosis commission wants host candidates who are of strong enough personality so that it is a true blending and not an overwhelming of the host by the strength of the memories in the symbiont. I think this is very well topped off when Jadzia is confronted with her first host initiate evaluation, ending the episode saying, ""I'm not Curzon,"" showing how she is distinguishing herself from the personality and decisions of the last Dax host. I never saw that as her living more honestly than in her past, or being able to be more true to herself, she is being confident in her own identity as a link in a chain. I am highlighting some of this not as a total defense of how I see the situation, but to give an example of where my perspective is coming from.

I'm open to having my perspective broadened and I don't think that having different opinions has to be a zero sum game, so I may not agree with everything put out there; we get nowhere without discussion. I can acknowledge that I maybe am focusing in on the wrong aspects of this discussion, so I'm open to a different aspect to help with my understanding.",1645822503,startrek,0.4019

Either you aren't listening to your science advisers, or you need to hire actual scientists, because the so-called scientific premises for each season ... 4 for 4 ... have been, to put it mildly, absolute rubbish, and the dart-board generated technobabble doesn't come close to covering up how rubbish they are. More importantly, please hire some writers with at least a modicum of COMMON SENSE. For instance, if your main character has a phaser, LITERALLY UP HER SLEEVE, AND can render a foe unconscious with a pinch of her fingers (you know, because you wrote her as Spock's unknown sister, FOR NO SANE REASON), please, PLEASE, PLEASE, don't think the audience so dumb that they won't laugh themselves blue in the face when she body launches herself at said foe, fails to subdue him with a head-leg-lock before getting stabbed in the thigh, and then uses SAID PHASER to cauterize the wound. Your show is chock FULL of this kind of face-palm stupid writing.",1645811911,startrek,-0.296

The new star trek series Discovery Picard Arent bad they are just designed for a different audience,"I've seen thousands of posts on Facebook about discovery and picard being badly made or just being SJW fan service, so I didn't watch it.

But I got to thinking, most if not all of these people actually complaining about canon inconsistenties like spock having a sister and holograms existing before TOS were of an older generation who have watched the older series.

The jokes about Tillys weight and Burnham crying were coming from a younger generation.

I decided to give both series a chance and while I'm only 23 I've watched All the original (Quad?)ilogy Like TNG,DS9,VOY,ENT. I've also watched TOS aswell and while I thoroughly enjoyed all of them save for the odd episode here and their I watched them before the new style series were even in concept stages. 

But after watching discovery S1-3 I still quite enjoyed it, I just see it as its own self contained story that lends from the original series.

With picard I didn't like some of the choices made with the story (Icheb for one) but I still enjoyed it on its own merits. 

I just simply think the new style star trek series are for a newer audience with expectations that are drastically different as one would expect with a gap of over a decade between the two.",1645803046,startrek,0.431

Canon Connections Discovery 4x10  The Galactic Barrier,"- The episode title, “The Galactic Barrier”, refers to the energy barrier which surrounds the Milky Way Galaxy, introduced all the way back in the original series’ second pilot, “Where No Man has Gone Before”.

- There are a number of translation devices visible on the table at Kovich’s briefing including:  
    - A Starfleet combadge, circa 2399 first seen in the PIC episode, “Maps and Legends”  
    - A Starfleet universal translator, as seen in the TOS episode, “Metamorphasis”  
    - A Starfleet handheld communicator, circa 2266 first introduced in, “Mudd’s Women”  
    - An United Earth communicator introduced in the ENT pilot, “Broken Bow”  

- Kovich claims that *“Vulcans surveyed Earth for almost a century before making first contact.”* Official first contact occurred in 2063 as depicted in the events of the movie “First Contact”, but as shown in “Carbon Creek”, the Vulcans began surveying Earth in 1957 in response to the launch of Sputnik.

- Kovich mentions a *“Three hour tour”* of the galaxy, alluding to the TOS episode “The Galileo Seven”, where an away team including Spock, Scotty, and Bones was lost during a mission and had to repair their shuttlecraft using only coconuts and palm leafs.

- Trying to dissuade President Rillak from joining the *USS Discovery* crew on their mission, Admiral Vance declares, *“They’re leaving the galaxy; we’ve never done that,” which might be true if he’s only accounting for the living memory of Federation citizens in the 32nd century, excluding those who arrived via time travel. The *USS Enterprise* traveled outside the galaxy in “Is There In Truth No beauty?” and the *USS Enterprise D* did so as well in “Where No One Has Gone Before”.

- It was established that the galactic barrier is composed of negative energy in “By Any Other Name”.

- Tarka claims that the galactic barrier will *”fry a frontal cortex[…]” We’ve seen in “Where No Man Has Gone before” that the energies of galactic barrier can can have a profound impact on those with psychic abilities, and it’s possible Tarka is saying Book’s Kwejian empathy might make him especially susceptible.

- Bryce has a moment with Saru where he declares he’s excited to be leaving *Discovery*. According to Saru, his time aboard the ship opened up a lot of opportunities for Bryce, so it’s good that he’s following dream to travel to Toronto and become a train porter.

- Saru shoots his shot with President T’Rina. Previous painfully awkward interactions include Geordi’s date with Christy Henshaw in “Booby Trap”, Geordi meeting Leah Brahms in “Galaxy’s Child”, and Harry Kim not being ready for how forward Seven of Nine would be in “Revulsion”.

- While travelling into the galactic barrier, *Discovery* is hit by gamma ray from a radioactive burst. When *Enterprise* breached the barrier in “Where No Man Has Gone before” Spock was unable to detect any radiation.

- In one of Tarka’s flashbacks, Oros has a panic attack, repeating, *“His head,”* after an alarm sounds. Last season in “Scavengers” we saw that the control disks the Emerald Chain affixes to prisoner’s necks include an explosive that can be triggered if someone tries to escape.

- Tarka claims that targeting a specific universe with the Oros’ multiversal transporter would require a massive energy source. In the mirror universe episodes of DS9, inhabitants of the prime and mirror universes could cross over as easy as going down the street for pizza, but it has been established in season three of “Discovery” that the mirror universe has drifted too far to reach in the intervening centuries.",1645791263,startrek,-0.128

I enjoy/respect/support what Star Trek is trying to be. I accept and celebrate the inclusivity that star trek is trying to normalize. I will forever strive to be what Star Trek has taught me that humanity should strive to become.

Why did they add a window and another turbolift to the DiscoveryEnterprise,"I haven't seen Discovery so I'm not sure if it is ever explained, but why the hell did they add a window and that second turbolift? I understand the change to the Enterprise overall was controversial with fans. Personally, I can get by some of the changes as artistically updated, but still within canon. But I don't understand why they felt those two changes were necessary.

I understand people say it's more ""realistic"" but it just conflicts so much. You're telling me Starfleet put viewscreens on their ships, then removed them around Pike's time, then put them back in from Kirk through Nemesis before putting windows back? Will they make up their mind with the windows?

The second lift if more of an OCD nitpick on my part. If there had ever been any examples of it on the original Enterprise before its refit, I wouldn't care as much. 

Now listen, I'm not trying to say ""keep the 1960s stuff"", though it seemed to work on TNG, DS9 and ENT. However, some things need to stay consistent. I wouldn't have any issues with Discovery ITSELF and older ships having it, but Enterprise needs to stay a little more faithful, regardless of artistic changes.

Either way, Memory Alpha is calling it a refit between The Cage and Where No Man has Gone Before, so I'm going to stick with that to help my OCD.",1645748168,startrek,0.0

Do not give Eaglemoss your credit card number," 

Hi  all, I'm a subscriber of the Enterprise-D Build-Up Kit, and y'all need  to be warned that if Eaglemoss has your credit card number, they will  abuse the ever-living heck out of it, lie to you about it, and claim  they told you about it in notes hidden in other topics.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Without my permission or authorization, Eaglemoss decided in  addition to the Enterprise-D, that I should also be signed up for  occasional ""special orders"" that automatically get billed and shipped to  me which I didn't order.
2. Eaglemoss claims I agreed to this (I did not) and that it's in  the FAQ about the subscription. I went back and looked, and there's a  mention of it in a section called ""What are free gifts?"" which then also  has a throw away statement under the section about free stuff that they  also are going to send me not-free stuff and charge me automatically.
3. When notified about the first ""special"", I emailed them the same  day and declined it, in October 2021. Eaglemoss customer service replied  to the email, proving they received it. They billed me and shipped it  in February 2022.
4. The dates are important because Eaglemoss just emailed me and  claimed that they did not receive my cancellation of that special order  until after they shipped it. This is a lie.
5. As an unrelated but similar issue, they recently notified  everyone they would start double-billing everyone and double-shipping  people by default unless we opted out within like three days of  receiving the email. As a budget-conscious person who had recently  paused the subscription to save money, the idea they can just decide to  start double-charging me whenever they want is... insane?
6. Eaglemoss currently holds a coveted F rating with the Better  Business Bureau. Most of the complaints are for charging for unwanted  orders. Eaglemoss rarely replies.

Do not give Eaglemoss your credit card number. I've already agreed to  a subscription totalling nearly $2,000 and these shady underhanded  crooks aren't satisfied.",1645726848,startrek,0.4404

The mod team of rStarTrek stands in solidarity the with the Trans community and their families,"On February 22, Texas Governor Greg Abbott officially directed the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate to begin investigating trans children in Texas receiving gender affirming care with the intent of prosecuting their parents as child abusers. The directive interprets Texas law as such that doctors, nurses, teachers, and other licensed professionals who don’t report such “abuses” could themselves be subject to legal repercussions.

This order represents yet another attack on the already oppressed trans community, seeking to intimidate the parents of trans and gender non-conforming children into forcing their children to adhere to a societal ideal lest they themselves be subject to investigation which may result in criminal penalty and their children being taken into state custody.

We stand in solidarity with our trans friends, family, and colleagues, with trans children and their families. As fans and moderators, we do not tolerate transphobia or any other forms of bigotry on r/startrek, and feel that perspective should apply to the real world as well.

Current and former moderators of the subreddit have pooled together [$250 to donate to Trans Lifeline](https://i.imgur.com/lGdWaJl.png), and we would encourage other members of the community to join us as they’re able.

My gripe with Lt Cdr Nilsson ST Dis,"ST has always had an issue with recurring characters being paper thin. That's fine with me, unless that character is seemingly close to the rest of the Bridge Crew...like on the level of eating at the captain's table, and joking around with them.

That's Lt. Cdr. Nilsson. I wouldn't call her a background character in any shape or form, in fact I'd go as far to say she's a side character. Now this is what irks me: there's so much more that happens between the lines of the show. She's always in the shadows: you'll never he Burnham or Saru say: Nilsson, prepare the spore drive--she's the spore drive ops officer(I only know that because of memory alpha).

*(to Raffi, Elnor, 7 of 9)*&amp;nbsp;

**Picard:** Q... he went back in time and turned our world into a polluted, totalitarian _nightmare_!&amp;nbsp;

*(cut to lab)*&amp;nbsp;

**Jurati:** ""Peachy...""&amp;nbsp;

**Borg Queen:** A single change, in Los Angeles... ""2024.""&amp;nbsp;

**Picard:** To save the future, we have to repair the past.&amp;nbsp;

*(cut to La Sirena)*&amp;nbsp;

**Rios:** ""Hold on...""&amp;nbsp;

**(off screen female)**: There is someone there to help... Seek ""The Watcher""...&amp;nbsp;

*(Scene with Soong and Q, passing the blue bullet shaped vial)* &amp;nbsp;

**Q:** I want _you_ to remove an obstacle...&amp;nbsp;

**Rios:** 21st Century Earth is so intense!  But ah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.&amp;nbsp;

**Picard:** We have to find a way _back_!&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** ""This is not a lesson... it's a _penance_!""&amp;nbsp;

Reflection on Next gen,"I just read the interview with John de Lancie about returning as Q and he was asked ""What is it about humanity that Q is so obsessed with that he feels like he needs to keep testing them and manipulating them and just getting involved in their lives?""

Part of his response is In The Next Generation, in “Encounter at Farpoint” I say, “Why do deserve to be out here?”

Now realistically writers can't plan out an entire series but isn't it fun to think the this could be why in so many of Picard's choices he picks the moral and just way. Look at sisko you talks to another commanding officer who betrays starfleet for the Maquis and says ""I'll have your uniform if you come back"" Now look at Picard going after a friend shooting up Cardassians, catches him, turns him, and then tells the Cardassians basically I know he's right we're watching you. He did what was technically right and basically betrayed his friend for the moral choice. Fans of TNG we know there are many more examples. Just made me think it's a nice motivator to say look Q, we have passed are quick to judge quick to war way",1645651208,startrek,0.0

CBS Studios Reactivates Starfleet Academy Trademark Alongside Section 31 and Kills Off All Other Trademarks for Potential Shows,"Link to screenshots is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarTrekDiscovery/comments/szgrq3/cbs_studios_reactivates_starfleet_academy/).

The Mirror Universe is Weird,"While it is nonetheless fun for both the actors and the audience to see the cast of various shows play over-the-top evil versions of their regular characters, this mirror universe that has featured in every show but TNG and Voyager (as far as I can remember) is made stranger and stranger each time the concept is visited.

For one thing, that this universe has a completely different history and everyone acts totally differently, but somehow the exact same individuals who are named the exact same thing are not only born-- but they pursue the most similar career path and end up serving on the exact same ships, or-- in the very least-- they end up interacting with the exact same people.

For that to happen, not only would the extremely unlikely event of the person's same parents have to get together despite the radically different universe-- the exact same sperm and egg cell would need to merge in order to create the same person. And the parents would each have to decide to name them the same thing and their life would still need to lead to serving on a starship and they would need to make the decision at roughly the same time and starships by the same name and mostly same design always get put into production.

Yet all the characters of this parallel universe dating all the way back act almost the polar opposite way they act in the regular universe to produce such almost identical results. Okay, so we have infinite paralell universes and so in the space of infinity there is a chance for even the nearly impossible to somehow still occur.

Except-- its not identical. The other weird thing is that the Terran Empire is actually more effective than the Federation of Planets... somehow. The Terrans have this constant relentless predilection to undermining and backstabbing one another, alienating everyone and spreading well-founded mistrust. They kill each other over the most short-term gains. And its all being headed by a single self-centered Emperor/Empress who makes arbitrary decisions based on his/her personal whims and is surrounded by people looking to kill him/her and seize the throne... a government system that we can very much show does not work. And yet... what is the result?

They have gone to war with the Andorians, Orions, Klingons, Romlans, Cardassians and everyone else-- all at once-- and won. Star Fleet having allied with many other alien races has struggled not to lose wars against half of these alien empires. It nearly got wiped out again and again despite superior cooperation and people being altruistic towards one another. Star Fleet would always pull out a clutch win, but just barely.

Realistically the Terran Empire ought to have collapsed under its own internal in-fighting. In fact, that was precisely what happened in the first episode in TOS that featured the concept. Yet instead they manage to successfully conquer everything where the Federation has struggled. And while maybe some of this could be explained by employing more ruthless  and aggressive battle tactics, it really is difficult to believe that their fragile command structures would allow them to get as far as being in a position to employ such tactics.

Overall I am not sure what the take-away about the Mirror Universe is really supposed to be. After all, the message of Star Trek was supposed to be ""imagine how much humanity could accomplish if all nations put their differences aside and cooperated as equals towards the betterment of everyone."" A celebration of infinite diversity in infinite combinations. And the Federation carries forth that concept by showing how virtually every enemy ultimately ends up getting won over and becoming part of the greater whole.

But then you get this counter example of this universe where everyone is a sadistic, evil nut job and somehow they are even more successful.",1645601876,startrek,-0.1779

How did you get into Star Trek What are your favorite moments from any show or movie and why,"It's a simple discussion, but I figure people would want to share another topic regarding free opinions about what they like.

I got into Star Trek by watching ""The Undiscovered Country"" as a kid.  Later on, I found out TNG was airing on television (We caught the episodes during the third season).  After watching the season finale of ""The Best of Both Worlds"", I was hooked and needed more.  Alongside the TV show, I found old VHS tapes of the original movies and binged them nearly every day.  I even recreated events from the show by means of building Legos and K'Nex models and using dry erase marker to simulate battle damage (I was a nerd, I know).

Today, I still love Star Trek and I often go back to various TV episodes of older shows.  I'm not entirely impressed with Discovery, Picard, and Prodigy, but the series as a whole will always stay with me.  

Although, I found ""Lower Decks"" to be amazing.",1645557515,startrek,0.5204

BElanna is the focus of almost every 3rd episode of Voyager,"I didn’t notice it until now, but almost every season (except, ironically, the 3rd) has a B’Elanna-centric story as the 3rd episode.

- S1 E3 (Parallax) - B’Elanna adjusts to being chief engineer for a Starfleet ship.
- S2 E3 (Projections) The Doctor finds only B’Elanna and Janeway on the ship.
- S4 E3 (Day of Honor) B’Elanna dumps the warp core (and professes her love for Tom ❤️)
- S5 E3 (Extreme Risk) B’Elanna keeps endangering herself.
- S6 E3 (Barge of the Dead) B’Elanna struggles with Klingon afterlife.
-S7 E3 (Drive) A shuttle race puts tension on the relationship between B’Elanna and Tom.

The only outlier is S3 which is about Tom, Harry, and the Chute.

As somebody that doesnt like STPICs depressing outlook I get it,"I only saw the first episode and I think I get it.

ST:PIC is a story about a Boy Scout Captain that kept on drinking the Federation Kool-Aid and he noticed it tasted bad a couple times and the couple times he noticed it previously, he just brushed it off as ""Isolated Incidents"" and the straw that broke the Camel's Back was Starfleet's reaction to the Mars Incident. I think his Kool-Aid was only good because Picard was supposed to be Starfleet's posterchild because the Enterprise is a name of legacy and their Captains saved Starfleet's ass many times in the 23rd century, so Starfleet appointed somebody of his values to be the posterchild of the Federation to show how ""amazing"" the Federation is and most of the naughty stuff the Federation did was under his nose and most of the times Picard caught them, it was very easy for the Federation to call that an ""Isolated Incident"" and threw him a bone in ""Measure of a Man"". Starfleet hid their true colors from their Star Captain.


I can see why Picard is cynical, imagine being indoctrinated into ideals and built your sense of identity around said ideals and realize the people that taught you what you believe don't believe what they thought you.


Starfleet corruption has been around even before TNG, Kirk witnessed Starfleet enslaving people. So this is beyond DS9 Darkness. I really don't like the ""Utopia is actually a dystopia"" trope. If I wanted a dystopia, well, I would read the leaked Snowden Documents.",1645539183,startrek,0.0191

You have a time machine unlimited bribe money and a cando attitude Which untold Star Trek of any series episode do you convince the studio to make,"For me it would be DS9 just prior to Body Parts. Kira, Bashir and Keiko on the runabout when things get bad and Bashir (and Kira! Consent matters!) choose to save the baby. 

I’d have them crash land and have the situation slowly deteriorate while they struggle to repair enough systems to call for help. And I’d have Bashir outline exactly what Kira is signing up for and have her actually weigh up the possible consequences before making her decision. Plus a few nice bonding scenes between Kira and Bashir, Bashir and Keiko, and all three of them for character development. 

I’d end it with their signal being received and Sisko and O’Brien beaming down, O’Brien only has eyes for Keiko so he misses Kira’s new bump at first and has a real heart-shattering moment at the sight of Keiko’s flat stomach before Bashir reassures him.

Mirror universe theory,"First of all I want to apologize for my awful grammar. 

This is a long one, but I've seen some discussion around when the prime timeline, and the mirror universe split, and it's been rolling around in my mind for a while. I think the Aegis are the answer,  (a lot of this evidence comes from Beta cannon.) 


So we know the Aegis have an interest in preventing world war 3, and they were active well before the 1960's when we see Gary 7 in assignment earth.

So the question is did they fail? Did they abandon earth? 

I think the answer is no. My theory is that the Aegis have the ability to see possible futures, and see the potential impact a fascist earth would have on the galaxy. Seeing this they start to abduct humans (maybe around 1937!?) And genetically modifying them to then generations later send them back to earth. 

These agent would be sent to prevent ww3, but not all ww3's.  I think the ww3 they are meant to prevent is one that would have happened closer to world war 2, leading to a more fascist America. 

This would have given it more time to for the fascist ideals to become engrained in the culture. The would have led to the government we see referenced in Q's trial of humanity as the status quo, and not something to rebel against. Meaning that the zephrym cochran in this timeline would be more xenophobic, leading to how first contact went in ""In a Mirror, Darkly"". 

Anyway back to the Aegis they didn't fail at preventing world war 3, they couldn't have it was inevitable.  the Aegis prevented a word war 3 that would have lead to a worse world war 4 that would have then lead the the rise of the terran empire. 

So basically the Agis pull an even bigger reverse prime directive than we thought. 

So that is my theory I give it to you the Trekkers of reddit to tear apart.",1645506376,startrek,0.0

That's about when DS9 started, is that the only big change there though?

Just wondering who I should be praising here, season 3 is really polished and interesting. They say season 2 was the most chaotic on set, obviously there was a reason Roddenberry stepped down. Is there any other obvious reason I'm missing why season 3 is so damn good? That is where DS9 took off as well so maybe that's just them getting in a groove.",1645503508,startrek,0.25

Comparing the animated vs the live action shows,"Lower Decks and Prodigy have been so much more fun to watch than any other recent Trek, and I've been trying to come up with a few specific reasons why.  I would argue that it comes down to the stakes of the plotlines of the respective shows, and the benefits of animation in general.

Post contains some spoilers.  Probably.

The stakes:
The best episodes and arcs in Star Trek have been about the characters, not the universe.  When the situation is ""The Evil Bad Guys are going to frame our captain for murder,"" my reaction is ""Oooh.  How are they going to figure out this problem?""  When the situation is ""The Evil Bad Guys are going to try to kill all living things in the galaxy,"" my reaction is ""Shrug.  It's been done.""

Let's compare some storylines:
Disco, start of season 2:  What are those red signals?  
I thought that this was an interesting story line at first, let's see them try to solve the space mystery.
Disco, end of season 2:  All life everywhere will die if we don't stop the evil computer!
Uh huh.  Sure.  

Picard, start of season 1:   Can Picard overcome both an intransigent Starfleet as well as his personal trauma and rescue the robot?  The storyline has potential, as we are rooting for the character we've known for so long to return to greatness.  
Picard, end of season 1:  We must stop the robots from contacting the evil robots who will end all life everywhere!  Oh no, a space octopus tentacle!  Lucky for us, the evil Romulans, who sacrificed billions of their own people to stop synthetic factory workers from being built on Mars, didn't use any of their 200 plus ships to drop a bomb on the relatively defenseless hippie robots.  
I still have a bad taste in my mouth over that writing decision.
Compare this to Picard talking to Data about life, friendship, mortality.... That, to me, was the best part of the season.  The best parts of Trek are the characters, within the universe.  Not the universe itself.

While Disco and Picard try to scare us into being emotionally invested with the biggest stakes possible, the climax of the season finale of Lower Decks is asking us to wonder how Mariner is going to grow as a person and get along with her mother while helping to save the ship.

Also: If you've already announced that the series is picked up for another season, you can't have a storyline saying that humanity or even all biological life forms will be killed by some evil computer or evil robots.  It just isn't credible to the audience.  (The exception that proves the rule is The Best of Both Worlds.)  Alternatively, if you have a show set years before other shows in the timeline, you can't have a storyline saying that all of humanity might die.  We know that the crew of Discovery can't fail at the end of season 2 because they aren't going to permanently retcon every other Star Trek show out of existence.  We know that whatever Picard season 2 does with the timeline, Disco is still going to be around a few hundred years later.

While Disco and Picard have plenty of solid episodes, well written and acted, that are not OMIGODTHEUNIVERSEISGOINGTOENDUNLESSWECANREALIGNTHEEPSCONDUITSANDREVERSETHEPOLARITYOFTHESTRUCTURALINTEGRITYFIELDWHILESHOUTINGVERYLOUDLY, unfortunately, that ends up being most of the show.

The benefits of animation in general:
Suspension of disbelief is a bit easier for animation as compared to live action, so it is easier to let things slide when the plot points don't make sense.

Disco, season 4:  Let's let the captain and her boyfriend (who is not part of the crew and not part of Starfleet, and the crew and Starfleet are all ok with him hanging around and joining high level meetings because it serves the plot so therefore we shouldn't ask any obvious questions...) go by themselves to break into a jail run by evil fascists, which is probably filled with lots of murderous defense mechanisms, and try to free a bunch of prisoners, who may be dangerous, before the space monster destroys the asteroid! 

My reaction:  This was a stupid writing decision in a show full of stupid writing decisions and I just don't care anymore if they succeed or fail.

Prodigy:  Let's fly the spaceship while some kid is outside trying to fix something and ignore that it is pretty windy out there and he might fall off.  

My reaction:  Well, to be honest, it is a cartoon show for kids, I guess we can ignore that.

Lower Decks, season 2 finale:  Can't we fly around the giant space debris?  EVERYONE SHOUTS AT ONCE, ok, ok fine.

My reaction:  That was amazing!   We in the audience know that the Tamarian is right, and it is bringing the audience in on the joke...  this is how Star Trek works, and this show is lovingly making fun of that rather ridiculous concept that the writers forget that space has three dimensions.

Also a key benefit of animation:  Alien races that aren't just humans with stuff pasted to their foreheads.  Voyager especially had the challenge of finding more and more and more ways to glue something onto someone's forehead to make them appear non-human.  Compare this to the characters of Prodigy or Lower Decks.  You can't use live action actors to create Dal and Gwen and Rocky and Murf and Jankom at the same time, it is just too much to ask of a production team.  Linus in Disco is well done, but presumably that isn't so easy to work into production, hence why the character is barely seen.

Author author and measure of a man,"Nearing the end of my Voyager rewatch and just watched author author.

I find it odd that datas case was never once mentioned. Seeing as it would surely be a landmark case and even could be used as precedent.

Ok holograms and androids are not technically the same. But isn't a hologram really just an android without the body?

For the purpose of determining if they are considered a person with rights, I would argue the are both a programed ai. I baffles me that in 2372 or what ever year it is there they still need to argue this.

They even cover a lot of the same issues, and they wanted to make basically a race of datas to essentially be slaves. Isn't that what the doctors ""brothers"" are now? I know the doctor technically won his case, but still deemed ""just a hologram"" and personally for a time when we have this federation that considers itself to be more enlightened they are so quick to dismiss holograms as nothing more than a program.

The doctor fulfills all of the criteria of being sentient and should have rights.

In fact, the Irish village holograms on voyager were sentient too. Once they had been on long enough they totally became self aware.

The problem with the new Star Trek is that it is always saving the Galaxy Repost As the mods deleted my older post told me to discuss in in a relevant thread then deleted the other thread,"The problem with the new Star Trek Is the high stakes of saving the Galaxy. I’m not Just saying it because I just dislike for prenise I’m saying it because it has been established again for the galaxy is big. The size of the galaxy that was established in TNG deep Space 9 and VOYAGER Is way too big for there to be a logical threat that could attack the entire galaxy. Breaking the skin is like putting Harry Potter spells in Star Trek. But even if this was excused, the fact discovery is likely going to now save the galaxy or be involved in a galacticwide affair three times is just bogus. Even if you assume that the federation is an outlier in that every species only saves the Galaxy Once, it doesn’t make sense that the Milky Way would still be populated by humanoids if every species encountered a threat to the galaxy because the odds of every single species saving the Galaxy once and them still winning is too low.",1645447817,startrek,-0.4019

Opinion TNG DS9 and ENT got bad initial reactions because their first seasons werent good,"Opinions are my own. Not talking about VOY because that's a whole other can to open.

This has been kicking around in my head for a while. People always point to the bad fan reactions of these shows and say these reactions were short sighted, that fans didnt like something new. I'm not saying that isn't 100% true, but i think there's a bigger reason. I say it's because these shows were not good when they started. It wasn't until a few seasons in (all around the third season, funny enough) that the quality of the shows improved and that's when fan opinion changed. 

Think about it. You're a fan in 1987, you tune into TNG, and you watch Code of Honor! You would be right to think this show was bad! Same with Move Along Home or Unexpected. These shows we love didn't start out well, they grew into themselves. There is a reason that we rarely talk about the early seasons of these shows with the same fondness as later seasons. 

Again, I'm not saying there weren't fans that hated the shows for the fact that they weren't what came before. I'm saying, let's try to see these criticisms with some perspective.",1645406914,startrek,-0.7101

Need Help On This Crossover Of Trek Star Wars And Doctor Who," I need some advice; I've been trying to write a multi-crossover story.

For context, Uhura and Scotty got together and had a child in between ""TOS"" and ""Motion Picture"". However, a year before the film (specifically 2272), the then two-year-old child, Penda, Uhura’s sister Samara and her brother-in-law, Yafeu, hopped aboard Lunar Shuttle 94 (a shuttlecraft that transported visiting families of crewmembers). With the two pilots and 3 other passengers aboard, Lunar Shuttle 94 was making its way back to Earth when a mysterious wormhole whisked them away. After 4 long years of searching, the Federation had the 8 missing passengers presumed dead.

Unbeknownst to anyone, Lunar Shuttle 94 had been transported to the Skyriver Galaxy (a.k.a the “Star Wars” universe). Crash landing on Tatooine, the shuttle was set ablaze when the hermit, Old Ben, Owen Skywalker, Ackmena, Tork and Skywalkers farmhands had helped in the rescue. Unfortunately, 7 were found dead either from the impact or from the flames’ fumes. As for the eighth victim, the toddler was on the brink of death when Old Ben had used the Force to heal her with much success.

Sensing that the child, the dead and the craft were not of their world, Old Ben had a small ship and its 7 hidden away from the Empire and buried it all under the sand dunes. And as for the child, now dubbed Kari, she’s not to know until she’s older. In the meantime, Ackmena would raise her as her niece with son, Laze Loneozner (who was 14 at the time along with Luke, Camie and Biggs), serving as her older cousin.

Long story short, Kari- from the time she was 6 ½ to 12 ½ , would go with her family to Lothal then to Coruscant to be watched over by the now Jedi master Luke who was made aware of her mysterious origins by Old Ben’s ghost after Palpatine’s fall. And as Kari grew older, Luke would look into her memories to get more insight on her past. When the girl turned 19, a series of unfortunate events let her, Luke and his companions to uncover the remnants and corpses of Lunar Shuttle and moved it to Luke’s Jedi Temple where it would all be safe from grave-robbers and Sith Lords who could be a threat to Kari’s home planet.

Fast forward to 2293; shortly after “Undiscovered Country”, the Enterprise is visited by Doctor Who. The Seventh Incarnate to be exact as he’d been sent to help with the upcoming journey. He even brought in Carol Marcus, and her coworkers, Jamal Scott (Uhura’s nephew and adopted son) and Aida M’Benga along for the ride. It wasn’t long until a magnetic storm sent them to the Skyriver Galaxy which turned out to be like Hoag’s Object; a galaxy within a galaxy.

Through telepathy on part of Luke, Spock and The Seventh Doctor, the Enterprise managed to get to Coruscant where Luke, Leia and Laze told the party everything they knew involving Kari. at first, Kirk couldn’t help but be skeptical; for all he knew she could be a clone, an actress or a salt-sucking monster. But Luke’s team made it perfectly clear that Kari isn’t a clone, nor a fraud or a monster; she’s just a 23-year-old girl who’s desperate to know if she’s (biologically) a part of any family. Besides, if Luke and his friends wanted something out of the Enterprise, they would’ve found a more simple, convenient way to get it.

And even though Spock and The Seventh Doctor managed to mind-meld Kari’s brain for her memories, Kirk still wants to be sure. So, he sends Kari alone to the Enterprise where McCoy and Chapel can give her a full examination and four DNA tests to clear the air.

In the meantime, Kirk, Spock and The Seventh Doctor would perform an examination on Luke, Leia, Mara Jade and the other Jedi involved to get a better insight on the Force.

While I’m still working on it, I still have issues on a few things. And just so you know, I’m only going by the shows and the films. Then again for “Wars”, I’m going by the original 6 films with some characters from the sequel trilogy and “Legends” being present there. Still, I want to go by the stuff made before 1991 for a more realistic feel; like this could’ve been made in real life, you know. Anyway, here are the problems:

\-Should I include other “Doctor Who” companions? In the story’s prequel series (set in 2269-2270), the Third Doctor has to help the Enterprise prior to “Spearhead From Space”. During this, it’s revealed that Uhura’s a descendant of Glyn Williams (the astronaut from “The Tenth Planet”) while Scotty’s a descendant of the Highlander, Jamie McCrimmon, which helps The Doctor become close friends with Scotty’s family. With The Seventh Doctor getting Jamie to help with the story, it could mean that our two favorite Sci-Fi Scotsman meet…but what other purpose could Jamie serve?

\-Then there’s Susan Foreman; I’ve been thinking about including her in the story but we already get a telepathic Whovian with The Doctor. What part could she play?

\-Should there be tension between the ""Wars"" and ""Trek"" characters? Luke would be able to sense their goodness and could telepathically communicate with Spock. But would Kirk be suspicious of Luke's Force powers and the Jedi? What about the other leaders of the ""Wars"" galaxy? Would they be weary of the Enterprise? Should there even be tension at all?

\-How much should the Force, itself, help Kari in her return to her biological family? I was originally going to make her a Force-Sensitive (with her being the Mildred Hubble of Jedis), but one commenter (rightfully) pointed out how unrealistic that would be as Scotty and Uhura were normal humans. Granted, I had come up with her abilities being either from a recessive gene or due to the Enterprise crew finding the Jedi to have a high ESP level. Yet, I don't want her to come off as a Mary-Sue. Not to mention it’d give a pointless subplot on Kirk finding Penda/Kari too dangerous for Earth.

\-What would the reason be for Kirk and the main crew not bringing up Penda all this time? Was the subject just too depressing to discuss (especially since the shuttle has been missing for so long)? Would it be too awkward? Did they already grieve and move on as it's been years since the shuttle passengers had been presumed dead by the Federation? Or did they not bring it up for the sake of Scotty, Uhura and the other families affected? Especially with Scotty also losing his nephew in ""Wrath of Khan""?

\-How do I portray the other crew members who lost their families? How would they react to finding Penda/Kari alive? Should there be bitterness? Should there be joy?

\-When should Penda/Kari, Uhura and Scotty reunite? We know they're going to so should the scene be done earlier or at the end to give it more emotional depth? During the DNA test should Kirk separate Penda/Kari from her potential parents to avoid the awkwardness and heartbreak if the results were negative?

\-Would both Uhura and Scotty have hope of Lunar Shuttle’s survival or should it just be Uhura who would have the most faith?

\-Should I include a flashback where Sybok uses the tragedy to brainwash Uhura during “Final Frontier”? I was originally going to have Sybok’s ghost take part in the Scotts’ reunion but with him no longer being a concern, would the flashback be rendered pointless? To get a look at the flashback, here’s the link to it:

Demo of Romulan War and brilliance of Enterprise Vulcan trilogy,"Hello

I have been rewatching ds9, then Voy and finally Ent. And realised again that 4th season Vulcan trilogy gave us a terrific insight like we have never seen or tought before. And why early series Vulcans are really has lack of emotion usually. Until this trilogy, we only knew they choose to supress emotions becase they have violent tendencies. We didint really  know repuracations of those tendencies. 
Now, Babel, United and Aenar is the showrunners idea to how Romulan War would have told if we got later seasons. 
We would see Starfleet and other ships in action with their bridge etc and then we would see romulan side. Back and forth. And maybe some romulan ships would be remotely operated and allies wouldnt even know that.

On Voyagers EMH and the practicalities of away missions,"(FWIW I love Voyager and this is not meant as a *serious* critique)

I have something that has intensely bothered me for years that I need to get off my chest.

On Voyager, why the flip are they ever sending the Doctor on missions, or letting him leave the ship at all? 

As my wife and I were reminded when rewatching ""Equinox"" this evening, his mobile emitter is so shaky it can be turned off via a swift whack from a clipboard, and if it breaks and he gets deleted then the crew have no backup and no full doctor onboard (Tom Paris is a nurse, not a doc, and is apparently middling at his job). Now on one hand, the same could be said of any crew member who dies during an away mission: something as simple as a phaser blast or a misstep on a mountain pass could kill them, so my complaint isn't that the Doctor could die in a mundane way, and in many ways the ability for him to ""die"" the same as others from a broken emitter could have made for some great ""human after all"" pathos.

But he is their only doctor, and as episodes like ""Message in a Bottle"" and ""Life Line"" show, the crew is really screwed if he's not around temporarily or, god forbid, something goes wrong that means he never comes back. Surely if they insist on sending him out, they'd have online qualifications for someone aboard Voyager to sit Starfleet's equivalent of the UMAT and become a licensed doctor. They show Tom learning some stuff but he doesn't ever get to the Doc's level of knowledge, likely because he's part-time given his duties at the helm. So why not pick a few crewmen who can learn more medical things to beef out the support staff at least, or better yet see if one or two can spend seven years learning to be a full-time doctor? And if not, then why send your only fully -qualified medical practitioner into dangerous settings every other episode?

Bottom line, if the Doctor had ever had a real easy turn of bad luck on an away mission, for 70+ years Voyager could have potentially had to cure their crew with leeches and fishing twine.",1645356022,startrek,0.0

Captain: Andre Braugher, a human from Earth, and was a decorated war hero of the Borg &amp; Dominion wars. 

First officer: Ana de la Garza, a half-Romulan half-human, handpicked by an Admiral over the expressed wishes of the Captain. Mistrusted by the crew.

Security Chief: Daniel-Dae Kim, formerly of Starfleet Intelligence, and also a weapons expert.

Ship's Counselor: Peter Jacobson, a Trill and possibly the only friend to the first officer.

Chief Medical Officer: Anna Friel, a British medical physician and formerly in a relationship with the Chief Engineer.

Chief Engineer: Khary Payton, a Klingon exchange officer who has trouble with life onboard a Starfleet vessel.

How are the Cardassians written so well,"I'm pretty new to Star Trek, seen all of the Movies from TOS-Kelvin, seen most of TOS and TNG. Right now I'm going through DS9 for the first time and I'm half way through season four.
 And every episode focusing on Garrak or Dukat or even that has them in a supporting role are so great. Same with TNG episodes with Cardassians. Their morals and society being essentially the complete opposite of the Federations is fantastic. And even though many of the Cardassians are duplicitous or straight up evil, their logic is always sound and is consistent with their culture. I honestly think they are one of the best species in star trek and maybe one of the best species in sci-fi.

What do yall think? Any cardassian-centered episodes that are duds? Any underrated species in star trek that you guys find interesting?",1645336121,startrek,0.4101
TNG Preemptive Strike,"I hadn't watched this episode since it first aired, and I absolutely love both the writing and the acting. Ro's discomfort at the beginning of the episode presages her conflict with her mission as a Federation spy on the Maquis. And the parallel father figures between Picard and Macias representing duty and family perfectly establish Ro's inner conflict. And the final conversation between Ro and Picard with the intimation of prostitution illustrated how this mission defiled Ro's morality.


When I first watched this episode I remember being disappointed in Ro's decision at the end. But I missed all the nuance in both the writing and the acting in this episode. I truly didn't appreciate just how out of place Ro felt in Starfleet. Nor did I appreciate the importance family to her. The episodes of TNG that include Ro take not her on an arc, but me. Ideas that permeate Starfleet such as ""duty"" and ""honor"" mean very little to someone whose life had been shaped by suspicion, betrayal, and loss. Family, more than anything, meant more to Ro... and I couldn't be more proud of her.",1645334641,startrek,-0.128

No Star Trek friends,"I’m a casual Star Trek fan. Love me some TNG and Voyager, enjoyed DS9, cool with the movies, have seem some OG, and 2 seasons into Enterprise for the first time. I’ve seen some Discovery which I will complete after and look forward to trying Picard.

While I have nerdy friends, I have no one in my life who watches Star Trek which is a bummer when I want to talk it.

I just want to get off my chest that while I enjoy Enterprise, and how it manages to be appropriately ‘less’ futuristic, while being filmed ‘more modernly’ than its predecessors, I don’t have the same love. No hate, I will happily finish the series and like it, but for me, personally, the cast feels less fleshed out, which I feel is what makes me not have the same love? I’m only 2 seasons in, so MUCH room for character growth, but the cast feels less interesting than other shows. Personally, I have a strong dislike (borderline hate) for Tucker, I like T’Pol, Archer is a good captain, and the doctor is fun, but if anything happened to Malcolm, Hoshi, or Travis at this point, I wouldn’t be too heartbroken.

Where some of the hate coms from,"I haven't seen ""new trek"" because I haven't been interested in Star Trek for a long time, while the interest is coming back, I can't afford a Paramount+ account right now and will have to wait until I can to see them. I've been reading about the new shows though and how some have hate them. I think I've figured out one or the reason why, there are other reasons (much of which is terrible and hurts what little faith I have in humanity and America) but this makes sense for some arguments against new Trek I've seen (and does not hurt my faith in humanity and America). 

Earth is said to be a utopia in Star Trek, the Federation (or just Earth , or just humans it's not really clear) doesn't have money, poverty, racism, ect. The whole idea is [encompassed in this speech by Picard](https://youtu.be/Vsy4mjSHtcE?t=58) (warning: it's first season TNG, before it got good). Many Star Trek fans has taken that vision of the Federation as gospel. The new shows (from what I've heard and read) portray the Federation as much less than utopic. For people who accept and like that utopic vision of the Federation the less than utopic events seen in the new shows seem counter to what Star Trek is supposed to be thus going against the ideas of Star Trek.  
For those who don't care, see the Federation as less than utopic, or even dystopic (a conclusion I have come) these less than utopic actions in the new shows fit very well. For what ever reason some have latched onto the utopian ideas of the Federation thus hate the it the new shows for showing a darker side to the Federation.",1645319774,startrek,-0.5719

Is Michael on a Wrath of Khan arc in Season 4 of Discovery,"In \*Wrath of Khan\*, as has been pointed out before by many people, Kirk finally faces the Kobayashi Maru because he only wins by losing Spock; he finally gets caught out.

Season 4 starts off with Michael having a Kirk-like failure to grasp that there can be no-win scenarios in the first episode (not subtle, given the title). This is underlined by her &gt;!saying some very un-Star-Fleet things to the president about trusting her gut, justifying her cowboy behaviour, which she gets consequences for in not being selected for promotion.!&lt;

In Rubicon, &gt;!at several points, Michael is almost forced into the no-win scenario. Most particularly when she!&lt; &gt;!is almost forced into destroying Book's ship, saved in the last instant by more intel over the comm.!&lt;

In the past, I've found a lot of the behaviour of the \*Discovery\* crew really odd, compared not just to other Star Trek shows but to other star fleet characters within the show. This is something that's hampered my enjoyment, but I'm beginning to think it's coming to resolution now, that I should trust the writing more, and that Burnham is going to have a \*Wrath of Khan\* level loss at the end of this series that will ground her, and perhaps the crew as a whole.",1645315044,startrek,0.0

Wasnt one of TNGs greatest strengths its high functioning bureaucracy and professionalism,"I'm sure this has been brought up a ton of times before, but:

* The senior officers were mentally stable and disciplined most of the time, not having low esteem and continuously self doubting, as would be expected on a flagship.
* They were also very professional, capable and reliable, solving problems in true collaboration and discussion. Everyone seemed to be captain material.
* Everyone also had personal interests they enjoyed or pursued in off hours making it easy to connect.
* The captain was an ideal manager, not a superstar hero that saved the day every time. Relied on other more knowledgeable pros in their areas to come up with options. 
* In fact, the captain wasn't even allowed to lead away teams most of the time.
* Promotions were a thing that was offered and pursued.
* Mental health was extremely valued and urged

It is absolutely wonderful! I’m not sure if it’s nostalgia or what but I feel more invested in the characters and story than I have with any other show.

I love the stories, the themes can be very deep at times, generally the characters react how you would expect them to based on their various backgrounds, and the whole experience seems surprisingly wholesome.

Are the Kelvin movies the Star Wars prequels of Star Trek or the Star Wars sequels in terms of reception,"So I’ve never really Star Trek before outside of a handful of episodes and Wrath of Kahn. A few months ago I went to a thrift store and saw a steelbook of Into Darkness for only a $1. What i didn’t know was it had the 2009 movie and Into Darkness on DVD instead of a blu Ray version of Into Darkness. So I was pretty excited getting two movies for a $1 in a cool case. I watched both, really liked them, bought Beyond and really liked it, then watched The Original Series by checking it out from the library. I even got the Star Trek video game set between the first and second movie. 

So after getting into the franchise I was excited and started talking to a few friends I knew who were fans, but they weren’t exactly impressed. They said my experience of the franchise is going to be tainted having see the action packed movies first that butchered the OG characters instead of starting with the show. I’ll admit I don’t remember much of TOS outside of a few episodes, they all just kind of blended in, but I enjoyed it and can’t wait to see the rest of the original shows. 

After having seen it I can understand why people didn’t like the Kelvin movies, but i didn’t think they were that bad. I felt that while they were more action packed and there was more foul language it still felt like TOS, just better looking visuals. Are they actually bad movies or are they just poorly received because they used the original characters but recasted them as younger, hotter, more action movie actors and I’m just missing the point of TOS, or are these just Star Wars esc movies with a Star Trek skin?",1645290473,startrek,-0.802

The problem with the new Star Trek is that it is always saving the Galaxy ,"The problem with the new Star Trek Is the high stakes of saving the Galaxy. I’m not Just saying it because I just dislike for prenise I’m saying it because it has been established again for the galaxy is  big. The size of the galaxy that was established in TNG deep Space 9 and VOYAGER Is way too big for there to be a logical threat that could attack the entire galaxy. Breaking the skin is like putting Harry Potter spells in Star Trek. But even if this was excused, the fact discovery is likely going to now save the galaxy or be involved in a galacticwide affair three times is just bogus. Even if you assume that the federation is an outlier in that every species only saves the Galaxy Once, it doesn’t make sense that the Milky Way would still be populated by humanoids if every species encountered a threat to the galaxy because the odds of every single species saving the Galaxy once and them still winning is too low.",1645280565,startrek,-0.4019

Janeway went from a stoic captain who didn’t want to be too emotionally attached her crew to someone who cares about them deeply, like a mother. I would even argue that Voyager has more character development than TNG (only Data and Picard had development) but less than DS9. The relationship between Tom and BElanna is amazing. Janeway and Seven also had great chemistry.

Tarka,"Is anyone else beginning to wonder if Tarka is a Q?

I'm convinced that Tarka intentionally lured 10c to the Milkey Way so that he could capture their power source.

Tarka said he'd been working at this for 10 years, and that he needed the power source to *go home*. It sounds to me like Tarka and his friend were Q trapped in mortal bodies, cut off from the continuum. 

And won't that be the perfect setup to devastate Book? The person he'd been helping in order to avenge the destruction of Kwejian, is in fact, responsible for the destruction of Kweijian. But who knows. If Tarka turns out to be a Q, and he manages to get back into the continuum, maybe he'll snap his fingers, bring Kwejian back, and send 10c packing.",1645201695,startrek,0.0

Question about Kes and Neelix and still in the middle of the Year of Hell so no spoilers,"So I’m watching VOY, and I do like the show. Not as good as TNG or DS9 but still great. But It seems to me they (the writers) made an obvious mistake, unless I’m missing something. Kes and Neelix were always together, loved each other, and Kes fought off Tom Paris’s advances throughout the first few seasons. But towards the end of season 3… it seems like the writers forgot they were together? They talk to each other like strangers, or former lovers. But I don’t remember any point where they broke up, except for that Ep where Kes’s body is taken over by some warlord spirit (forget the name at the moment). But that seems like an obvious “oh, well she didn’t break up with him, that was the warlord spirit doing that, trying to escape”. Unless that was their break up? Can anyone clear this up for me? I’m happy they replaced Kes with Seven of Nine, infinitely better. But just curious.

Canon Connections Discovery 4x09  Rubicon,"- The title of the episode, “Rubicon”, is a reference to the idiom, *“Crossing the Rubicon,”* meaning to make a decision from which there is no return, and which is itself an allusion to Julius Caesar's crossing the Rubicon river, precipitating his civil war.

    - Caesar has been mentioned in Trek a number of times: In TOS, “What Are Little Girls Made Of?”, “Bread and Circuses”, “Patterns of Force”, and “Whom Gods Destroy”; “A Matter of Time” in TNG; and in DS9, “Improbable Cause”, though that was discussing the William Shakespear play named for him.

    - The DS9 episode, “The Die is Cast”, is named for Caesar’s reported remark, *“Alea iacta est,”* upon his crossing of the Rubicon.

- Nhan [Rachael Ancheril] returns! She was introduced in season two’s “Brother”, and was last seen in season three’s “Die Trying”.

- When Burnham points out that she and Nhan are close, which might make things awkward, Nhan assures her and Vance that, like many Barzan, she places *”Duty above all.”* This Barzan phrase was first introduced in “The Price”, and repeated by Nhan several times over the course of season two of DIS, and certainly not some new aspect of the Barzan people we’re just learning about this episode.

- When Nhan takes Burnham and Saru aside for a private briefing, Burnham turns the conn over to Nilsson. Though this doesn’t necessarily mean Nilsson is the *USS Discovery’s* second officer, it might indicate that’s the case. Nilsson is played by Sara Mitich who also played Airiam in season one, and was second officer under Lorca.

- Nhan claims that an analysis of the plans of Book’s ship has demonstrated a weakness in the freighter. A small thermal exhaust port only two meters wide is unshielded, and small, one maned shuttle will be able to fire a photon torpedo which will start a chain reaction which should destroy the ship. Just like bullseyeing Sehlats back home on Vulcan.

- *Discovery* launches a weapon meant to blind Book’s ship’s sensors while cloaked, causing only a ripple effect. Firing weapons while cloaked has always been a problem, though apparently one solved by the 32nd century. Previously we’ve only seen Chang’s prototype Bird-of-Prey from “The Undiscovered Country”, the Reman *Scimitar* from “Nemesis” able to fire while cloaked.

    - Stepping outside of the prime timeline, in the Mirror Universe the Terran Empire’s *NX-01* was able to fire while maintaining a Suliban cloak in “In a Mirror Darkly”, and in the alternate future of “All Good Things…” the Klingon attack cruisers were able to fire upon the *USS Pasteur* before dropping cloak.

- Book ignites a hydrogen cloud with a magnesium charge, hoping to warn off *Discovery*. In “Insurrection”, Riker developed the Riker Maneuver, deploying metreon gas at two Son’a battlecruisers which were then destroyed when their own phasers ignited it.

- The close-up of the DMA controller reveals it to be a glowing core enclosed by two rotating dodecahedrons. It has been pointed out that it doesn’t look entirely dissimilar from the model of the omega molecule shown in “The Omega Directive” which was a rotating icosahedron with a pulsating core.

- The *USS Mitchell* is assigned to observe the location of the DMA after its destruction, reporting the arrival of a replacement. Presumably the *Mitchell* was named for Kenneth Mitchell, the actor who portrayed Kol, Kol-Sha, Tenavik, and Aurellio in previous seasons of “Discovery” as well as voicing three characters in the LDS episode, “Veritas”. Mitchell has ALS, the progression of which has limited his ability to continue acting, and even prevented him from returning as Tenavik in “Star Trek Online”.

    - There are no jokes in the Canon Connections post, because Star Trek is serious business. But if there was, and I didn’t respect the hell out of Kenneth Mitchell, here is where I claim that the *Mitchell* was in fact named after Gary Mitchell, Captain Kirk’s best friend who developed extra-normal powers after the *USS Enterprise* traveled beyond the galactic barrier, and then had to be killed by a boulder in “Where No Man Has Gone Before”. Then I would make up some claim that Gary Mitchell returned from the dead and was actually Future Guy in ENT, and is now a celebrated hero in the 32nd century. Obviously though that would never happen, and it is ridiculous to even suggest the possibility.",1645186210,startrek,0.0
Just finished TNG,"I've been watching somewhat sequentially in terms of release since around 2020. Just got to the end of next gen.

It's a little different from finishing other shows because I know the character journeys aren't over yet. Especially knowing there's a Picard series out now. With TOS I felt a little more of a closing at the last movie, even though I know most of those characters have more to come in sequels and prequels and alt timelines. (If I had two wishes, the second would be to bring Leonard Nimoy back to life.)

Someone on this sub gave me a good guide for the newer movies vs the tv shows and how to watch, so I won't crack into those, but I'm starting DS9 soon. The finale left me with a craving for more star trek and I'm so excited by how much more there is.

Recently I started a Sci-Fi themed discord server for people to gather, chat about their favorite Sci-Fi related Movies, TV Shows, Books, Comics and Games, as well as give and receive recommendations for new Sci-Fi you may not have seen before.

Our main channels are for Star Trek, Star Wars and Warhammer but we have other channels to encapsulate other Sci-Fi. Since this is /r/StarTrek, I'll expand on that.

We have split the channels by era, the TOS era, TNG era and Picard Era, and yes, you can theorize within any of the channels (what if Kirk fought Picard?).

Additionally, we have recommendation channels. If you read a book you loved, saw a show or an episode of a show you thought was brilliant, or perhaps a comic issue that gripped you, you can recommend it in our recommendations channels.

If you like the idea of a bunch of Sci-Fi nerds coming together to discuss their favorite shows and give/receive recommendations for new Sci-Fi, stop by and check us out.

Some pyrotechnic effects in The Original Series look better than later series,"I've seen all of 90s-Trek a dozen times but somehow I'd only ever seen a handful of TOS episodes. I'm going through them all now on Netflix and discovering some of the pyrotechnic effects in TOS look better than later series. 

Several times when Kirk talks a computer into self-destructing it'll catch on fire, spew smoke and spray sparks. Or another where someone has sabotaged the Enterprise and the console catches on fire. There's something more visceral and real about these pyrotechnics than on 90s-Trek. 

I'm thinking about failing computers on TNG\~Enterprise. There's a lot of showers-of-spark effects to show ship damage and sometimes a smoke machine puffing clear white fog out from behind panels. Consoles explodes with a dramatic flash of bright white sparks, presumably it's some stock pyro device of gunpowder and magnesium to make a dramatic bang but it somehow doesn't feel as *real* as the 60s pyrotechnics.

I think this is because in the 60s pyrotechnics probably *were* more real. The sabotaged computer catching on fire and billowing grey-to-black smoke is the set actually burning. The explosion effects feel more visceral probably because they're subject to less safety regulations and they really are more brutal pyrotechnics. There's an explosion that kills a redshirt in episode 2x09 The Apple, it looks pretty dangerous and I felt the actor was at a genuine risk of being hurt by the explosion. 

Obviously the budget and spectacle of DS9 era pyrotechnics is much greater like Jake Sisko running through a battlefield in 5x04 Nor The Battle To The Strong. But somehow that feels sanitised and clinical and less violent than the explosion from 30+ years earlier.",1645101169,startrek,0.6369
Why didnt Picard bring a bedroll to the Klingon ship in Unification,"Every time I watch that episode, this puzzles me.

How hard would it have been to replicate something like that on the Enterprise before he left? I'd imagine a 24th sleeping bag for indoor use could easily be similarly small and comfortable. Knowing how Klingons like to sleep, and that they often aren't great at hospitality, it would have made a lot of sense to travel prepared. He could have put away his sleeping gear first thing in the morning so the Klingons didn't even notice, and gotten a decent night's sleep that night.",1645098838,startrek,0.0

How would he know that term when it was created on Earth. Even with the Universal Translator it is an Earth term. Or what about Ep 11 ""Latent Image""? Who is Ensign Jetal and where is Kes? Ensign Jetal was never in any season or episode before. Harkens back to the death and return of Lindsey Ballard. They kept saying it happened before Seven joined the crew.

If this series came out today it would be a better revival than DIS IMO.  For me it’s the absolute peak of Trek.  If someone came up to me today and asked which series to start with, I’d tell them to start with DS9 and to just google any questions about/references to earlier series.

I've probably watched this series 4 times over. It's timeless and is one of my top 3 Star Trek series. What makes this show special: chemistry between the characters, subtle/dry humor, great stories.

What if Star Trek had its own Andromeda Initiative,"Mass Effect always has been a Star Trek ""ripoff"", but in a more militarized way. This changed a lot with Mass Effect Andromeda, wich introduced the Andromeda Initiative. The main object of the Initiative was to unite the main powers of the Systems Alliance on the common goal of mainly, pacificly explore the Andromeda galaxy, to explore new worlds, discover new life, new civilizations, etc.

I believe this concept would work in a post-Picard era, when the Federation/Starfleet is in the need to reaffirm it's intentions as being a scientific/exploration driven organization. It would be a breath of fresh for fans and writers, because it would run away from the repetitive Romulan/Klingon/Picard/Kirk subjects and themes. It would bring new opportunities to create new worlds, new forms of life, factions, species, anomalies and the bast part is that the Federation would be a minority in this new Galaxy, with no influence and almost no resources compared to it's milk way counterpart, wich would create racial and political conflict, conflicts that the Federation wouldn't have the means to solve these problems in a military way.",1645066957,startrek,0.0
The Bajorans are the only humanlooking alien race the Federation seems to care about,"Think about how many alien races looked exactly like humans that we saw in TOS, TNG, Ent and even Voyager, and the vast majority of them we only see for 1 episode and never again. None of them are ever given much thought.

Bajoran's look exactly like humans besides their noses and they're basically treated like the most repressed people in the quadrant. And while they were under occupation, we've seen so many other 1-episode races involved in war or politics similar to the Cardassian/Bajoran situation. But it only gets 1 episode and is forgotten about as soon as the next ep starts.

It's sort of the same way Vulcans decided to help humans when we discovered warp drive, but none of the other human looking aliens. I know most of it is due to the location of the wormhole, but it's always interesting to me the Bajoran's are given special treatment.

Latinum is merely a resource akin to gold. It’s mined from planets or nebulas and is hard enough to get that it’s valuable.

The Federation is massive and well resourced. Within its boarders must be ample Latinum reserves which they mine and accumulate.

While this currency isn’t used internally, it’s still used externally. It’s distributed as a stipend to crew members on the frontier or used to pay for goods and services with non-federation members. 

Also while there’s no monetary use within the Federation, when interacting with external non-federation money-driven races the Federation may very well charge them for goods and services, as it would be the logical way to interact with those races.  The profit would likely go into the pot of money that is distributed to crew members on the frontier who need to live in those frontier environments where money is used. 

Said crew members who received a stipend still have a limited supply of Latinum whenever it’s distributed, and so bartering and betting between each other at Quarks etc is still valuable to them.

The system makes sense — Latinum is just a valuable resource to which the Federation happens to attach no value to. But that doesn’t mean they have none of it, or can’t interact logically with races that use it.",1645057579,startrek,0.5574

How would yall feel about the next Star Trek movie being a sort of remake of The Voyage Home,"Title kinda says it all. There are those stories going around, as they always seem to, about making a fourth Star Trek movie in the Kelvin timeline with the reboot cast. I know the stories going around a few years ago involved Chris Hemsworth coming back to play Kirk's dad or something like that, but I wanted to discuss one alternative which would be a sort of modern-day retelling of The Voyage Home.

**Premise of the Original**

For those of you possibly unfamiliar with The Voyage Home, the basic premise of the movie is that the crew of the Enterprise have to go back in time to save the whales. They have to do this because an alien species who were friends with the whales many centuries ago were friends of the whales and are pissed off that humans drove their friends to extinction by the 23rd century, The crew spends some time in 1980s San Francisco, get into and out of trouble, grab a couple whales, and then head back to the future. It's amazing. 

**Worth A Shot**

I know fans would get prickly another direct reboot of a previous film, and there would definitely be some problems to avoid. But I think it would be great to see the reboot cast deal with a smaller-ish scale issue and focus on them as people and how they view the early 21st century. How does the crew view the 2020s in their universe? Here are a few considerations: 

**Bell Riots**

Depending on how quickly the next Star Trek film goes into production, we could expect it to come out in either 2023 or 2024. If the crew were to go ""back in time"" to the present day San Francisco, that would mean the reboot crew would be around at almost the exact same time as the [Bell Riots](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bell_Riots). The Bell Riots deal heavily with homelessness, gentrification, and wealth inequality, which are more relevant topics than ever. This could be a great way to have the crew talk about some very socially relevant issues and the ways that humanity eventually overcame some of these issues together. And I mean come on, that timing is just great. 

**World War 3**

In the Star Trek timeline, WW3 begins in in 2026. So going back to 2023/2024 would mean the crew knows that everyone they interact with is about to experience mass destruction. Whole cities get wiped off the face of the earth through nuclear war, and hundreds of millions of people are about to die. How does the crew react? Do they meet any nice people, learn they will die in the war, and then try to change their fate? Do they debate making a bigger change to world history than just taking a few whales? 

**Budget**

The recent Star Trek reboot films have had production budgets hovering around $200 million, while making on average $400 million ish. Once you factor in marketing costs, the cut theaters take, and the rising pay of the actors who have more star power than when they signed on a decade and a half ago, a high budget Star Trek film doesn't really make much financial sense. But if they were able to have a huge portion of the movie take place in the present-day, Paramount could probably save a lot of production costs. 

I know something like this would be super unlikely, as it would not necessarily a hugely marketable blockbuster or anything. But it seems like the pieces are there for a really cool Star Trek story! But what do y'all think?",1645052303,startrek,0.0

Some love for Kirk,"As I go through my Star Trek run having just finished Enterprise.   
Second episode into the Original series I am reacquainting  my love for Kirk.

He is a bit old fashioned of course. And very much your man’s man they liked in the era.

But also has so much charisma. And I love how much early on they are already establishing him as the strategist. He is playing 3D chess with Spock and Spock is commenting on how his mind is not on the game and gets him in check only for Kirk to checkmate him. Spock the smartest man on the ship gets out manoeuvred

Kirk is the trickster strategist. He makes you think one thing only to pull another. He is the bluffer. The corbomite manoeuvre shows this (can’t wait to reach this episode) He shows it again in Wrath of Khan making Khan think he has him trapped buried. Tricks the Klingons into boarding his ship only to have beamed off the ship just before and set it to blow. Which shows he keeps his cool under pressure. He is able to make hard decisions under pressure. 

He has the qualities of both McCoy and Spock. The passion and heart of McCoy with the logic and reason of Spock.

All the Captains have their qualities but Kirk is the one I would least want to go against in battle, or play poker with.

He us and always shall be, my favourite Captain.",1645046412,startrek,0.6369

Is it necessary to watch Enterprise before watching modern Trek,"I moved back in with my parents since the pandemic started. I grew up watching The Original Series, The Next Generation, and the Trek movies, but I had never seen The Next Generation all the way through from beginning to end.

Rykers character development is great,"By the end of TNG Ryker was one character that hadn't changed much at all. Picard, Data, and Worf had all had some quite important growth or challenges, including more Worf over on DS9. Then we have Picard's issues with the Borg in First Contact.

Meanwhile Ryker is verbally criticised by other characters for staying under Picard's wings in the show itself. He fits the jock first officer role reasonably well, what with the chair mounting and smugness/over confidence. However there are glimpses of a more social beast underneath with the Jazz, and the simmering sexual tensions. However by the end of TNG not much has come of that. 

In Insurrection we see the rekindling of his romance with Deanna. However it is only in the last couple of years that we have seen the real potential in Ryker's character. When he finally gets his own ship the Titan, he really relaxes into the role of Captain and becomes somewhat buccaneering. And later he retires and becomes a complete cuddly family man. Although he suffers some heartbreak he still clearly has a heart of steel and is ready to come back to active duty at any time. 

The softening and growth of his character has been long in the making and subtle in its development. He has gone from a sometimes mildly annoying character to one of my favourites in Trek canon.",1645026301,startrek,0.6249

Star Trek Convention Concerns,"Hey Fam --

So my wife and I have attended the Creation Entertainment Star Trek convention in Vegas annually now for the past 10+ years. We were actually pretty shocked to learn they lost the ""Star Trek"" license over the pandemic and now another company is handling the ""officially licensed"" convention.

Last years convention in Vegas was... okay. I'll totally give them credit that it was still a pandemic year, but there were still a ton of last minute (previously confirmed) cancellations of big names resulting in a pretty anemic lineup compared to years prior. It felt off, and perhaps it was just the pandemic -- but being the first year without the Star Trek License, it definitely felt wrong. I was really not feeling Creation's attempt to maintain a Star Trek atmosphere with their ""Threll Empire"" storyline. It felt like you were at a Birthday party where the parents decorated with Dollar Store Star Trek knock offs :P

Now this coming year in 2022, not only has the venue changed to Bally's (while the Rio was meh, Bally's is *SUPER* meh), but they also reduced the number of days from 5 to 3. 

Looking at the new ""Official"" Convention (""Mission Chicago""), while also a 3-Day convention, it appears on the website they only have \~9 guests confirmed with the convention itself only 2 months away? The same company arranges the Star Trek Cruise which seems to have a much better lineup of guests.

Curious folks thoughts -- it just seems super weird to me that, while it feels like Star Trek as a franchise is the best it has ever been, convention options seem to be at a low point. Maybe we just need to start going on the cruise ;)",1645019464,startrek,0.0

Luckily at Christmas time after the reboot movie came out, my brother’s let me stay up and watch it with them. (Say what you will about the reboot movies, but they are what made me actually dive into Star Trek once I got a job and started earning my own money and could by consoles and subscribe to networks like Amazon and Netflix and etc). Even then, outside of that said collection of scripts turned into book form for TOS, I have still completely ignored Star Trek books. So, to basically the only place I can talk Star Trek, I ask where I should start. Preferably chronological order, but honestly I would love people’s personal opinions as well.

Also, why didn’t Georgieo just destroy the transmitter that Leland/Control had her use in episode 11?

Has Star Trek changed that much New fan perspective,"Hi, I have been watching Star Trek for two years by now. My first contact was with the Kelvin timeline, I loved it, wich motivated me to watch ST: Discovery, wich I also enjoyed a lot, even if I didn't liked Michael as protagonist (poor writing) but I loved Tilly optimism and charisma (my favorite character of DIS), and obviously I enjoyed the battles, most of the bridge crew and the spaceships, like, a lot. 

After watching season 2 of the Discovery and meeting the Enterprise and Mr Spock for the first time (in this timeline), I was once again motivated the watch more of it, then i watched the Original Series, and my god, it's is so good, and for me, still the best series of the saga, even after watching TNG and ENT, even with some cons, like some bad taste commentaries about woman, wich would sound sexist today, but I tend to ignore because it's from the 60s. 

And thinking about what people say about what the series has become, I cannot see how different is the new Trek from the old Trek beyond the use of CGI. I've noticed how the themes and main drive of the series still the same, and I think I can counterargument what people say about the new Trek using the old Trek as the base of my argument.

1. Constant conflict and battles.

One of the most reccuring arguments, are that Star Trek has become too much of a ""Star Wars  clone"", but the amount of space battles that appeared in TOS can't be ignored, a lot of space encounters involving other factions has resulted in a space battle, like the first encounter with the romulans, Scotty starting a bar fight because the Klingons (wich are just dirt stained humans here) ""offended the ship"", the ""Corbomite Manouver"" encounter... And that's without counting the hundreds of fist fights that happen in almost every episode. So, I can't see how Discovery and Picard are doing something different in this point specifically. I understand that Burnham was impulsive and started a war, but my point is that the problem isn't the war itself, but is that Michael wasn't severely punished for that, wich I think is a serious failure from the writers in that moment of the series, wich would saddly occur on other occasions (Season 3).

2. Progressivism and diversity.

Star Trek was controversial in the 60s because of it. The first interracial kiss, diversity in the cast, bringing acceptance and good ideals to other, more violent cultures, and I believe that's still the main drive of the series even today. I understand the argument that ""diversity for the sake of diversity is bad/wokeism"", wich I agree in the most cases, but not in Star Trek. I see a lot of people complaining about female protagonists or black characters, but this sound somewhat racist or sexist, because it isn't the first that this happened in the series, what has changed? You can blame bad writing as much as you want, but saying that Star Trek is failing because of diversity, wich is the literally what made Star Trek special in the first place, it's pretty hypocritical. But to be fair, the character that I despise is Adira Tal, that character was super forced and it was diversity for the sake of it, again, bad writing, not diversity issues. 

3. Grey morals. 

This one is pretty stupid, saying that the federation is somewhat perfect, or everyone in the crew is a perfect human being doesn't make sense at all, a lot of episodes from TOS show corrupt Fleet officers, racist federation members, trigger finger captains, wich isn't different from what we see from any other Star Trek series or movie. The grey moral is what make the Star Trek universe more comprehensive and the characters more relatable, because they are humans, but different from us, they are least trying to do better and improving from every lesson, wich is what Discovery tries to do most of the time.

4. The new Trek doesn't respect Gene Roddenberry vision.

I wanna see someone counter this argument (lol). Most of Gene Roddenberry concepts didn't make through the original series, mainly for being too impractical and unrelatable in a writing perspective, but it was his creation, so he used to interfere in the first opportunity that appeared, He wrote only 14 episodes, wich most of them he was a co-writer, and the episodes he had the most participation, were some of the worst episodes of the entire TOS, he was a amazing world builder, but a horrible writer (wich explain his conflict with many other experienced sci-fi writers that worked on Star Trek at the time), none of his episodes are in the top 10 of critics, and fans. The situation got worse with TNG, when he had almost full control of the first two seasons, wich are the most disliked seasons of TNG, it had good episodes, but I see that most people agree that the first two seasons are the most boring. When Gene died, ironically, it's when Star Trek blew in popularity, with the writers having more liberty to create a more relatable and believable Star Trek universe, that defined a whole cultural fenomenom. Do not fool yourself, Star Trek has survived all these decades not because of him, but despite him, most of the series content was made after his death, not before. And to most fans, as i see, everyone loves the controversial, not Gene's vision: Deep Space Nine or love what the TNG has become after he left.",1644984384,startrek,0.3182

But then in the finale, when he leaves to go become a prophet, he doesn't even say goodbye to Jake!!  And not only that, but he also abandons his unborn daughter for Kasidy to raise alone.  It just strikes me as so incredibly out of character.  I'd half expect him to turn on the prophets in order to find a way back to his family.

Star Trek of the present day Picard era should come up with a new antagonistic race,"I was thinking about the state of intergalactic affairs in the post-supernova era, and I realized that the Federation has very few political enemies or rivals.

The Klingons have been allies for over a century. 

The Romulan Star Empire dissolved after the supernova and became the Romulan Free State. Not only are they much weaker than before, but also Federation-Romulan relations seem to be trending for the better, with some setback due to the Federation pullout of the relocation.

The Borg were crippled by Janeway destroying their network in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.

The Cardassians were ravaged by the Dominion, leaving the planet to go through political reform and focus on rebuilding.

The Dominion were defeated, and Odo's presence in the Great Link is likely to lessen the imperialist tendencies of the Founders.

The Ferengi are going through progressive cultural reform under the leadership of Grand Nagus Rom.

The Xindi, by this time, could very well be Federation members.

With all this in mind, I think Star Trek should introduce a new race or political entity to rival the Federation. Or they could expand on older races we rarely see. Some smaller antagonistic forces that are still around include: Gorn, Tholians, Orions, Kzinti, and Breen.

What do you guys think? Should they create a new race and/or expand on an old one?",1644974120,startrek,-0.4019

My dad described TOS 1966 as Jack Kennedy in space Starting TNG 1987 again I was surprised by how much Space Reagan was in there,"As someone born in the early '90s, of course I grew up on TNG so it was weird for me to see how how much drastically more progressive for its time TOS was as compared to TNG. I'm on s01e21 ""The Symbiote"" and Crusher and Yar are both just straight up doing a Nancy Reagan ad. ""You see Wesley, drugs can make a person feel good...""

This is piggybacking off another post about how little depth the Klingons had in TNG as compared to DS9. They were more complex in TOS as well. In TNG they're just savages who don't even fight that well! Worf's primary good quality is he restrains his primal instincts. 

They handle situations very much as a colonial power who's evolutionary superior to other peoples. I get that American exceptionalism nationalistic sort of Reagan vibe from it. Not to even hate on Reagan too much, he famously did take in refugees as part of that Exceptionalism, they did do things out of the grand benefaction of the empire, that was part of what gave them the moral high ground. The Federation plays this game as well although they are fully earnest of course. It's odd because I remember TNG as a communist kind of show because they don't have money and that is still true, it was still progressive for the 80s. But it seemed like more of a lateral step from TOS than I was expecting. La Forge is a great character but he seems more neutered as compared to Nichelle Nichols who was singing like an angel once per season and even gets to kiss the Captain. (That kiss wasn't great, Kirk acted like he was miserable the whole time. But Uhura canonically enjoyed it lol). TNG is definitely more progressive with regards to feminism with the exception of them not letting Troi wear underwear in that thing lol.",1644971032,startrek,0.2263

Finally caught up with S4 of Discovery,"I finally got round to watching S4 and I think Discovery has started to find it’s stride.

(Spoilers for S3 and S4 ahead!) 
S3 was mostly establishing the future and their place in it, and I think they carried this on well so far, but they’re actually moving forwards rather than dwelling on the past (their’s and the Federation’s) and the new ‘big bad’ is interesting, feels like a proper Star Trek puzzle that’s going to have an interesting and hopefully satisfying conclusion. (I think that will be the big thing, as S2 and S3 had weak conclusions.) 

It also feels like we’re finally starting to see and hear from more of the other senior staff and there’s been at least a couple of occasions in this series where Burnham hasn’t had all the answers and even some good moral dilemmas. 

Then there’s been some very solid episodes and ideas within it. The one with Tilly and the cadets had some great character development moments for her and the others and had some lower decks kind of vibes with the crew. 

The prison episode, the debate and the argument with Burnham and Booker was well done and it really felt like watching Star Trek. I think Star Trek generally does pretty well with these kind of prison episodes and this is no acception 

Then the one with Zora and the coordinates, was excellent - not as good as Measure of a Man by far - but a very interesting and different take on a similar concept.

In TNG season 4 Picard says there are representatives from 13 different worlds serving on the Enterprise Doesnt this seem a little low for a ship of 1000,"I heard this line and it immediately raised a red flag because that seems like an awfully low number for such a massive ship. Here are the ones we know about plus ones who seem highly likely to be on-board in season 4:

2.  Betazed (Troi)

3. Quo'noS (Worf) 

4. Vulcan (Selar)

5. Bolaris IX (the barbers, several unnamed crewmen)

6. El-Auria (Guinan)

7. Omicron Theta (Data)

8. Benzar (Mendon, although to be fair it's possible he left the ship before this episode since his first and last appearance was 2 years prior)

9. \[This alien species\]([https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed\_USS\_Enterprise\_(NCC-1701-D)\_command\_division\_personnel#Alien\_crewman](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)_command_division_personnel#Alien_crewman)) which appears in season 4

10. \[This other alien species\]([https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed\_USS\_Enterprise\_(NCC-1701-D)\_command\_division\_personnel#Alien\_bassoonist](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)_command_division_personnel#Alien_bassoonist)) which also appears in season 4

So this only leaves only a few more species out of the hundreds of crew members we don't directly meet. Surely there are some Andorians, Tellarites, and many more common Federation species on the flagship? It's also being generous in assuming Picard is talking about species homeworlds, and not including all the colonized planets that person could also be from.

What does Dilithium actually do amp how is it recycled An Analysis of Dilithium in Star Trek,"#  Before you begin-

* The best TLDR I can do- This Post explores what dilithium could have done as a ""regulator"" and as a power source. It also looks at how Dilithium may have been recycled.
* This is technically Part 2 of a 3 Part series, but I have tried to make it a standalone. Sorry for any inconsistencies. (Part 3, about black holes in a week or so)
* Part 1 (On Antimatter) [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/pvcwxl/analyzing_antimatter_how_it_could_be_produced/). Please read [u/pfc9769](https://www.reddit.com/u/pfc9769/) comments &amp; my reply to it. (Yes, I managed to procrastinate for 4 months).
* This post is accurate till DIS S3 (S4 Not available in India), but from what I can indirectly see, there isn't any major information about Dilithium in DIS S4.
* (Someone Please check my Maths &amp; science too)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Regulator-

Dilithium in M-AM Reactions may have performed a similar function as Graphite rods in Nuclear power productions. Graphite rods absorb or reduce the speed of neutrons produce during nuclear reactions. This in turn reduces the amount of neutrons with enough velocity to break down a radioactive atom to its daughter isotopes &amp; release energy. Thus the amount of graphite can be varied to control the rate of reaction. They also act as safeguards against nuclear meltdowns or explosions by preventing chain reactions over a certain amount to continue.

But I said dilithium performs a *similar* function, not the same as Graphite. This is because it doesn't need to control how much antimatter or matter reacts (we can do that) or how it reacts or how fast it does (reduces power production). It may however do something about the 200,000 Hiroshima-Equivalents (Data quoting 12.75 Billion giga watts) being created every second in the reactor. **\[8\]**

\[***Warning- this is speculation (&amp; personal incredulity, however well-deserved)\]*** There is probably nothing that can survive 200,000 Hiroshimas within a few ten(s) to couple hundred meters (size of a Warp Core, at most). That much energy pretty much destroys anything as the temperatures produced are more than 10,000 Kelvins (18,000 F) at the very minimum **\[9\].** Also the energy produced in 10 seconds by the warp core is the lower end of the [total energy in a flare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare), which iirc managed to destroy a borg cube *(TNG: Descent, Pt-2)*

That's where Dilithium and it's link to subspace comes into play *(DIS: The Citadel)*. I theorize there are 2 different roles Dilithium might play, but it may as well be infinite until we get some concrete canon on this-

* It acts as a sort of transmitter (of energy) to subspace. Dilithium sends a huge chunk of the energy created to subspace. This in itself doesn't create a warp field (aka subspace displacement field)- that is done by the warp coils using warp/electro plasma. Warp plasma, here, is probably just relatively energy dense plasma, made from a tiny fraction of the energy from the M-AM reactions. The warp coils use the energy from the plasma to coalesce the energy in subspace (from the dilithium) to form an energy field that enables FTL. *Wait. I just created the perfect treknobabble.*
* Dilithium converts the energy from M-AM reactions into some sort of subspace energy (this at least has some basis in [canon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Subspace_energy)). This energy either creates some type of plasma, or is transferred to plasma, creating warp plasma. This plasma is transported via the EPS system to the warp coils, which in turn generate the warp fields.

I personally like option 2 as it feels more realistic &amp; less treknobabble-y, but any theory you create is just as valid. All I can say with (near) certainty is Dilithium probably does something with subspace &amp; the insane amount of energy required for warp, and therefore is involved in any method that produces that much energy, **including black holes &amp; M-AM reactions**.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power source-

I could only find 3 sets of dialogues mentioning anything similar to Dilithium power source (All TOS)

&gt;*\[Engineering\]*  
SCOTT: I've got bad news, Captain. The entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused. No chance of repair.  
*\[Turbolift\]*  
SCOTT \[OC\]: It's completely unusable.  
KIRK: No chance of restoring warp drive?  
SCOTT \[OC\]: Not without dilithium crystals. We can't even generate enough power to fire our weapons.  
\-*TOS: Elaan of Troyius*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Captain's log, stardate 3088.7: ......* two of our dilithium crystals are missing, and without them the Enterprise cannot operate at full power.  
\-*TOS: The Alternative Factor*  
&gt;  
&gt;MASTERS: (A woman in a blue uniform) Report on the dilithium crystals, Captain.  
KIRK: Yes.  
MASTERS: Whatever that phenomenon was, it drained almost all of our crystals completely. It could mean trouble.  
KIRK: You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify immediately.  
*-TOS: The Alternative Factor*

The first two quotes can be explained away easily as it could just mean they shouldn't/can't get enough energy from Matter-Antimatter reactions. This could be due to dilithium changing the energy into some other required type used by hose systems, or that the M-AM will produce too much uncontrolled energy, or something else.

However the 3rd quote seems to directly state that dilithium crystals have some sort of energy. And I can't fathom what can be ""amplified"" **\[10\]**. Maybe Dilithium is similar to superconductors in that it requires some external condition to function (or begin functioning). Only that it needs to be ""amplified"" or replenished by something every once in while.

Thus I **believe** that Dilithium probably acted either as an energy storage than an actual energy source. ***\[Almost pure speculation from this\]*** If it is a battery (storage), it stores some of the energy created within the internal structure for later use. This was most likely the result of energy passing through it, being temporarily stored, &amp; then released as required. The energy remaining after the previous usage would be used for the next startup (or for stuff that doesn't require considerable part of max power). Thus if it were drained, process that relied on it (probably things like maintaining orbit &amp; weapons) would fail.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recyclability-

Dilithium is shown to recyclable/reusable. While we never get an explanation for how it works, the names seems to suggest a few possibilities-

* **Dilithium Incubators** *(ST: Runaway, DIS: Such Sweet Sorrow)****-*** Crystal incubators exist in real life (kinda), so this (Dilithium Incubator) may do something similar to its function. From what I understand Incubators (a smaller version of temperature controlled rooms) are able to grow able to ''grow'' (protein) crystals or [crystallize proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_crystallization). Dilithium Incubators could perform a similar function by ''growing'' Dilithium crystals, or at least crystallize some form of non-crystalline Dilithium. **\[11, 12\]**
* **Compositors** *(TNG: Family, Relics; VOY: Innocence)****-*** The name says it all, they probably composite or combine drained or broken crystals to create new, usable crystals. These apparently have variants, such as the theta matrix compositor in TNG. **\[13\]**
* **Recrystallizers-** *(DIS: That Hope Is You, Part 1)* IF it this does anything similar to Real-life recrystallization, it indicates that usage of dilithium crystals in a warp core leads to impurities being introduced in them. This also suggests that the introduction of these impurities is the cause of Dilithium being 'used up', and that the removal of them is enough for reusing the crystals. **\[14\]**
* **High Energy photons-** *(Star Trek IV)* Dilithium apparently can decrystallize (whatever that means), making it ineffective as a regulator. This dilithium can apparently be recrystallized using High-energy photons that were released during Nuclear Fission. (Please read the footnotes for this) **\[15, 16\]**

# Footnotes-

\[8\] Little Boy had a yield of [15 Kilotons of TNT](https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-08819), equivalent to about 63 Terajoules (10\^12 Joules). According to Data (TNG: True Q), at least 12.75 Billion gigawatts (per something) is produced by the Enterprise-D. That equates to about 202,000 Hiroshimas. Even if we take [my limit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/pvcwxl/analyzing_antimatter_how_it_could_be_produced/) of 5 Billion Gigawatts, that's still 80,000 Hiroshimas.

**\[9\]** One second produces 12.75\*1015 KJ. Let's assume that plasma in the warp core is Hydrogen at solar core density- 150,000 kg/m3 . Then 1,000,000 m3 (100m\*100m\*100m) contains 150\*10\^9 kg of Hydrogen. Assuming the [increase in specific heat capacity](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/hydrogen-d_976.html) is linear with temperature (even though it appears to be converging), gives us

&gt;=&gt; dQ=mCdT  
=&gt; int(dQ)=int(m\*0.001346\*T\*dT) \[0.001346= **Δ** C/ **Δ** T)  
=&gt; Q=0.001346\*0.5\*m\*T2  
=&gt; 12.75\*1015 = 0.000673\*1.5\*10\^11\*T2  
=&gt; 12.75\*1015 = 1.01\*108 \* T2  
=&gt; T= 11235 K

While not insane highly, this is still enough to [disassociate H2](http://people.physics.illinois.edu/Ceperley/papers/102.pdf) &amp; melt pretty much anything. If we instead took the average solar density (1.4 g/cc) for the plasma, the temperature of the plasma is about 112 Kilokelvins.

**\[10\]** This amplification may help make the dilithium crystals a [Phonon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon#Lattice_dynamics) (&amp; see [this](http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~schauble/Phonons.html) too) of radiation/light/energy from power generation system. But this is pure speculation &amp; sounds an awful lot like a contradiction to me.

**\[11\]** Note that I could only find these incubators being used for protein crystallization, so it may be that Dilithium has some connection to proteins, or at least organic molecules (Dilithium is said to be an element though, so this has a high chance of being wrong). This MAY explain its connection to Biology, as seen in Su'kal.

**\[12\]** Most of the references I got are literally from the market itself, including advertisements, so these may be biased. The only specifications on how it works &amp; what it even might be comes from a [website that sells it.](https://www.mitegen.com/product/crystal-growth-incubators-floor-standing/)

**\[13\]** This has no basis in reality though. The closest I could come to is [Composite Crystals](https://www.jeol.co.jp/en/words/emterms/search_result.html?keyword=composite%20crystal).

**\[14\]** This seems to be soft contradiction of canon on why Dilithium becomes useless, so recrystallization in ST may not mean what it means IRL.

**\[15\]-** If 'high energy photons' can apparently make dilithium usable again, the lack of such processes in the 23rd Century is... illogical. High energy photons (whatever high means) aren't unique to Nuclear Fission, and can probably be easily made now, let alone the 23rd Century. This suggests that Spock probably meant some other particle.

**\[16\]-** This, again, suggests that some non-crystalline form of Dilithium exists, and Dilithium can be converted between the two forms.

Humans seem to be the only species that use idioms in Trek,"So, I was watching Trek today, and I realized aliens never really use idioms much. It seems every few episodes you'll get the classic exchange of a human talking to an alien, spouting some random idiom, to which the alien responds with some variation of, ""excuse me, what the fuck?"" and then just chuckling and saying what they really mean. But you never really see this situation in reverse. Aliens *do* invoke similes like the chatterers of Maljar VI, but they at least have the good sense to avoid idioms like the plague, presumably because they realize that they just won't make any sense to anyone but them.

They also do this with handshakes as well - god knows how many times we've seen an alien puzzlingly stare at an outstretched hand before conceding and grasping it. Aliens, on the other hand, do not really tend to presume in this fashion, and only established ally species such as Vulcans and Klingons tend to have their greetings mirrored by humans.

In a way this lends a certain naivety or even brashness to humanity - while other species seem a lot more deliberate in the ways they communicate with aliens, we just kind of go around assuming other species can talk our talk and walk our walk, like an overconfident stranger in a strange land.",1644878183,startrek,0.0

Star Trek Rewatch Enterprise completed,"Finished my first of the Star Trek shows in my run of rewatches, Enterprise.

I probably have not watched any of the Star Trek series all the way through since they all first aired. Just catching the odd episodes randomly.

I would say most of my feelings about Enterprise 20 years on are much the same.

First 2 seasons I like but they were finding there feet.

Season 3 was good. But season 4 it really found its feet with some of the best episodes in all Trek.

I did notice quite glaringly the differences with how society was then and how it approached television compared to now. There were certainly some questionable episodes on how they portray women that felt closer to the original series than say modern day discovery. it is surprising as it does not feel that long ago.

Trip had always annoyed me. And he did in the first 2 seasons as well on this watch. But he becomes far less annoying in season 3 and 4.

The opening music is still awful. But that said the visuals are probably the best of any of the Star Trek series opening credits. Certainly the most interesting to look at.

Overall I enjoyed it. Glad I have rewatched it again.

Anyone remember the game STBridge Commander from 2002 Im enjoying it tremendously,"Picked up Bridge Commander from the GOG releases, I had never heard of it before. Come to find out D.C. Fontana who was a writer on OST and early TNG did the script. It's really good, if you're not paying attention you can flat out blame the wrong party and get it wrong to varying degrees of consequence. Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner act and give a surprising amount of dialogue. The other actors include Andy Milder and Charles Rahi Chun who have gone onto become big deals.

The game mechanics are as close as they could get to VR back then. It's first person and you give commands to the station heads in order to accomplish tasks, it really feels like you're the captain. The combat is very true to the show and very enjoyable. Then you can switch to 3rd person and either fly manually or just pick what systems to target and choose from an extensive cinematic camera mode to watch it play out.

EVERY time I tried doing this in the past, the paint would come out terrible especially the metallic gold. It would pool together and separate leaving little circles/plate shaped spots on my badges. It was just so annoying. Well I finally cracked it! 

So all my molds were shot, the resin I used was old, but I still wanted to make some more practice pieces. Here are the progress shots so ignore that most of these have bad shapes/roughness etc...again bad molds, old resin, lots of rough work I ignored just so I could practice the paint method.

The rejects look like a certain Robocop 2 scene 😂 but honestly I was just trying many different methods to see what worked. The Generations badges aren't so hard to do, I just have to be more patient before masking the middle. The TNG badge is what was always hard because the three round parts are where the gold would always puddle together. 

I was only focusing on painting technique. And I really figured out what I was doing wrong before and what to do from now on. Before I would spray too close, put too thick of a coat on and I would focus on certain spots of the badges with the spray paint can. I think really the only way I can get it to work is if I spray in very light coats multiple times (and I didn't have to wait too long between coats). I also had to spray farther away and never, ever focus on one spot of a badge. I did notice though if I sprayed too far away I'd get orange peel. Anyway MISTING IS KEY.

ENT Stratagem,"I'm rewatching \*Enterprise\* and really enjoying the Xindi arc. I remember recording this show on VHS from UPN as a kid. Now as an adult, I'm getting a lot more out of it.

""Stratagem"" is one of my favorites. For a long while they let us believe we're watching another time-skip like we saw in ""Twilight"" - Earth was destroyed, the Insectoids are winning a civil war with other Xindi, and we're following the unlikely pair of Archer and Degra on the run. Then, halfway through the episode, we learn that this is only a simulation within Enterprise, meant to fool Degra into divulging information.

The acting from Bakula and Degra actor Randy Oglesby was fantastic. Despite the horrible things that Degra did, Oglesby manages to present a nuanced, conflicted character. The level of detail put into the simulator ruse made it believable - I think the whole writing and production team enjoyed creating this ""play within a play"". Depending on how closely you're paying attention, the second ruse of the episode may surprise you as well as Degra. The only thing I thought was missing was a discussion of the medical ethics of what Phlox did to these Xindi. Archer might believe that this was more civilized than the airlock torture from ""Anomaly"", but given Phlox's absolute insistence on patient autonomy in ""The Breach"", it's hard to believe he didn't have some qualms about wiping memories and implanting bloodworms.

The Memory Alpha [article](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Stratagem_(episode)) really surprised me though. I had no idea that the concept of this story dates to the 40s!

* Roald Dahl published the short story [""Beware of the Dog""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beware_of_the_Dog_(short_story)) in 1944, in which an RAF pilot is led to believe that he is recuperating in a British hospital, when in fact he has been captured by Nazis.
* The short story inspired a 1965 flim called \*[36 Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36_Hours_(1965_film))\*. Here, a US Army officer has been captured by Nazis and is told that the war is over and that he is in a US hospital in occupied Germany.
* [""The Train""](https://missionimpossible.fandom.com/wiki/The_Train) is a 1967 episode of \*Mission Impossible\* in which US forces construct an elaborate ruse in a train car to influence the decisions of a foreign leader.

I am writing a novel similar to Star Trek aand was hoping I can get help with an idea,"So I have two issues I am having trouble resolving

1. There was a dark matter anomaly enveloping the area of space my characters are in. Obviously because Discover is using the same thing I need to change that now. What an annoyign coincidence to be honest that just now Discovery is using the same idea, but kind of funniy at the same time. Anyway, Does anyone have a good replacement idea instead of Darkmater that is wrecking space? I can't use subspace because I think that is a term exclusive to star trek
2. Also, as if I can't seem to ccatch a break, instead of warp drive, I created a power system called Omicrom, which I thought sounded super cool. Now obviously I cannot use Omicron as it sounds like a disease, so I need a new name for my faster than light travel.

The 800 TOS Soundtrack Collection,"The [entire library of TOS music](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series_Soundtrack_Collection) was released by [La-la Land Records](https://lalalandrecords.com/star-trek-the-original-series-soundtrack-collection-limited-edition-15-cd-box-set/) in 2012, but it was a 5-CD limited edition. It looks like it was $225 to buy new and is unfortunately long out of print. 

You can still find it on [Amazon](https://i.imgur.com/zi6iLzA.jpg) \-- for a whopping $799.

Some other limited TOS tracks (*The Cage, Where No Man, Doomsday Machine,* etc.) were released as CDs and are easy to find on YouTube, Spotify, etc. But that's maybe 10 episodes. 

If you want to hear a certain track from any of the rest -- like *Conscience of the King*, *City on the Edge*, *Metamorphosis*, or *Elaan of Troyius --* you are out of luck. So much of the Season 2 and Season 3 soundtracks are only on this out-of-print collection.

Star Trek character tournament Qualifying Round 1 link,"Welcome to the Star Trek character tournament where we will battle out 144 characters to find the most popular. So here's how it's going to work:

&amp;#x200B;

There will be one poll a day (aiming to release at 22:00 GMT). For the first 24 polls we will be in the 'Qualifying' stage where the 144 main and some big recurring characters from every Star Trek TV show and film have been randomly sorted into 24 groups of 6 people. You will be able to vote for your faviroute character out of the 6 and the top 2 will progress to the next round. This will be called the 'Group' stage which will have 8 groups of 6 people. After this we will progress to individual 1v1 games. As an additional fun thing, in between the 3rd place playoff and the final we will have 2 extra polls which will be the 2 most popular and the 2 least popular characters from the group stage based on the percentage each character achieved (I'm basically just doing these extra ones so that the final result comes out on First Contact Day). The link to the full spreadsheet with all the characters and the order of matches (as well as other sheets for specific results and graphs) is linked here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VghOzKpWD1KqO\_aWBJ897acdR3P2hhBuOF6c1j5DtBE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VghOzKpWD1KqO_aWBJ897acdR3P2hhBuOF6c1j5DtBE/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

So, without further ado, here is the first poll. Qualifying round 1 is between Christopher Pike (The Original Series and Discovery) , Lily Sloane (First Contact) , Adira Tal (Discovery), Keenser (Kelvin Timeline Films), Jack Ransom (Lower Decks) and Hoshi Sato (Enterprise). The winner and runner up of this poll will secure a place in Group 1 and the other 4 characters will be eliminated. Here is the link: [https://strawpoll.com/woybdypaq](https://strawpoll.com/woybdypaq)

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information: if a character has multiple versions of themselves e.g. prime timeline and kelvin timeline, characters in non-prime universes will have this information stated. The Christopher Pike in today's poll is from the prime timeline. However, characters in the same timeline that have been played by different actors will not count as seperate characters. The Christopher Pike in today's poll counts as the character played by: Jeffrey Hunter, Sean Kenney and Anson Mount but not the version played by Bruce Greenwood. Also, if a character appears across multiple shows or films but is the same character, they are counted as the same character. The Christopher Pike in today's poll counts as the character that appears in 'The Cage', 'The Menagerie' and Discovery but not in the kelvin films because it is a different character due to the different universe.

&amp;#x200B;

This time tommorow, I will post the results of today's poll along with the link to the next poll.

Waking Dreams irl,"I figured you ask would appreciate my dream experience fromm last night.  

I'm currently at my family cabin and had a dream my sister showed up and was taking over my relaxing time here, and was begging very rude/obnoxious.  I realized she would never do this in real life and that I was dreaming. So I did Chakotay did, and started taping the back of my hand.  It wouldn't work, and I was getting very annoyed as I wanted out of the dream.  I even saw the reflection of the earth in the window and thought isn't that supposed to be the moon?

Tapping my hand finally worked, but I found I was just in another version of the same dream with more family members.  I finally walked up stairs and thought I'm not doing this.  Throughout trying to wake myself up by tapping my hand.

Star Trek Elimination Game,"Hey guys,

 I've seen this on a couple of other subreddits (notably r/westwing and r/Scoobydoo) and I thought that Star Trek would be a good franchise to do it with. In other subreddits it has worked by having a list of all the characters and voting off each character one at a time until the most popular is found. Obviously, due to the shear amount of characters in Star Trek that would be impossible so it would likely have to work in a staged format (like major sporting events e.g. the football world cup works).

Currently I've got a list of 120 main characters from the whole franchise who I think would work, my main question is: is there interest for this sort of thing?

If there is, I'll send out soon (hopefully this evening (GMT)) the first one (likely a strawpoll) and we can get started.

Here is the link to the spreadsheet with the list of characters, if you have others who you think I've missed, please let me know.

Just finished Enterprise some thoughts on the series spoilers,"I have mixed feelings about the series overall, but I can confidently say that I liked it. Perfect? No. Fun? Usually.

At first, I did not care much for Trip. I thought he was another basic Kirk-clone, like I thought Riker was meant to be early on in TNG. But he really grew on me, so much so that I would say that Connor Trinneer is in the top five best actors who played on a Trek show. So his death on the finale really bothered me, not just because a good character died, but because there was no real reason for the show to kill him. What do the writers think they accomplished with this? What payoff was there? They really just made it so that the audience could not enjoy the finale - its supposed to be this feel good powerful moment where Archer is about to give this big pre-Federation speech, and we don't feel good because one of the main characters just died. And they do not do his death justice at all. The crew does not grieve him and they seem really unbothered by it sitting in the audience in the Hall.

  Last episode aside, another thing that really bothered me is that the writers only serviced Archer, Trip, and Phlox as heroes. T'Pol, Hoshi, Reed or Travis never get to save the day. TNG and DS9 did a great job making every main cast a hero, but the 4 non-heroes of ENT are only accessories to the other 3.

Concept for a civilianfocused Trek show,"So, a bit of a weird idea and something of a thought experiment. I've been rewatching Star Trek Picard with a friend who is a long-term TNG fan - this is his first exposure to PIC, and we've both been loving the experience. We've just finished Nepenthe, and it occurred to me that Picard is the closest we've got to a series focused on a 'civilian' crew in Trek, divorced from the usual focus on Starfleet (even Prodigy has the goal of emulating Starfleet baked into its premise).

This got me wondering if an entire series could be focused on such a perspective, but without a heavy-hitter like Jean-Luc Picard to anchor our 'civvie' crew to the big picture. The idea stuck in my head and so I am blitzing out this pitch in a burst of energy to see what people think of it.
  
STAR TREK: PIONEERS  
  
Short pitch: If TOS was 'wagon train to the stars' and DS9 was 'frontier post in space', then this is about living and settling the frontier, during a time of gradually renewed optimism, displaying a mix of used-future and sleek tech, focused on putting the utopian ideals of Trek under the microscope of everyday life.

Our setting is post-TNG/Lower Decks/Picard. While the synth ban has been lifted and the Federation gradually recovering its high ideals, the galaxy is still reeling from the Romulan Supernova, but this also presents new opportunities. The collapse of the Romulan Star Empire means that the former Neutral Zone has been opened up for settlement and exploration, but neither the Federation or the Romulan Free State are willing to take a heavy hand in overseeing colonization efforts for fear of treading on the others' toes and inflaming old wounds. This has resulted in the environment we see in Picard in the former Neutral Zone, a new frontier in space where law and order are malleable and often under the custodianship of paralegal groups such as the Fenris Rangers. 

Our core cast will be a starship crew, but none as we have seen before. The SS Pioneer is a merchant vessel, but in her past life was an unimportant Starfleet vessel (Oberth or Miranda-class maybe) that was decommissioned and sold off into the civilian sector decades ago. She's an old lady who's been given a new name and a lease of life, her tried-and-tested spaceframe upgraded with whatever systems can be sourced and made to work. Instead of a warp-core, she has a second-hand Romulan singularity core, and her equipment and interior fittings are a cludge of repurposed gear purchased or bartered from any word or culture that can meet the required specs at an affordable price. Hull-space once intended for scientific research has been repurposed as passenger accommodations and cargo holds, and she can carry a maximum of fifty crew and two-hundred passengers, though the usual crew complement is closer to twenty or thirty. 

And, like classic merchant vessels from the Golded Age of Sail, she runs heavily-armed, for the galaxy can be a dangerous place. She doesn't have a dedicated Security Division, but the belligerent old Master of Arms makes sure that everyone aboard knows how to properly fire a phaser and operate in squad-formation when defending the ship, and on the rare occasions when the Pioneer gets into a scrap, oversees the ship's weapons and fire-control from the bridge

The Pioneer is one of a dozen-or-so ships owned by the Towards Dawn Stellar Navigation Co. Towards Dawn itself is effectively a cooperative of small starship operators banded together for mutual support, combining their economic interests into a body that can punch above their individual level. Ships within the Towards Stars fleet effectively operate as independent units, their Captains (and a few primary stakeholders) making-up a nominal 'Board of Directors' who represent the interests of their crews, and who meet up weekly via holo-conference to set company policy, barter jobs, review the figures, or trade gossip and banter over a few drinks. 

Ships within the company typically scout-out work available in their area and either take a job or pass word back via the company to see if another Towards Dawn vessel wants it - on a very rare occasion the Board Members might delegate/order a ship to take a particular job, but this is rare and typically quite democratic - there's no one individual owner who can force an issue or command the resignation/firing of a captain.

Shares in the company and its vessels are held primarily by crew members, relatives and outside investors (some larger concerns, but mostly small business-owners) who benefit from the services Towards Dawn provides. The company outright owns some of its ships and leases/rents others from their captains, who in theory can 'buy back' their ship at any time, though the price will include not just the vessel's own value but the cost of any investment Towards Dawn has put into the ship.

Towards Dawn is thus the equivalent of an Old West stagecoach company, and the Pioneer and her running-mates can be compared to seagoing tramp-steamers, working to no set timetable and bound for wherever the work takes them, but with the benefit of a unified administration that can point/direct/coordinate their efforts. This week the Pioneer might be transporting colonists from Sector 001 into the former Neutral Zone, next week taking a contract to provide support services to a Federation research asteroid, or transporting goods on behalf of a recently First-Contacted world or an independent Ferengi trader. 

They'll often be working solo, but sometimes pared with another ship of the line, or working in conjunction with ships of the Fenris Rangers, Starfleet or Romulan Free State etc. Towards Dawn will take on lawful (more-or-less) work regardless of who the client is, and boasts that it can find or contract a ship for any task - Pioneer is a good example of their average ship.

And there's plenty of work to be had in this uncertain era, and plenty of colourful individuals looking for work. Pioneer's crew is a motley mix of lifelong 'spacers' and 'fresh meat', and though arranged in a shipboard hierarchy wherein the Captain is God and the First Mate their strong right-hand, is going to be a lot more informal than what we'd see on a Starfleet vessel. 

A good portion of the crew is from species that have only recently achieved warp-flight, and who are using the opportunity of work aboard a starship to gain experience that will help themselves and their people grow as a spacefaring power. Other crewmembers include Starfleet reservists, former members of the Romulan Fleet, and anyone seeking to escape a checkered past or to make a name for themselves on the frontier. Thus they're a heady (and sometimes volatile) mix of waifs and strays and runaways, but over time will become a shipboard family, with romance, heartbreak, friendship, betrayal, fond farewells and new arrivals. This also provides a chance to see classic Trek races in new civilian-sector capacities - i.e. the ship's Surgeon is a Klingon who finds honour in the treating of wounds, and the Quartermaster a bohemian Ferengi who can put their hands on anything and who still values the aquisition of profit, but who sees that profit being in not in Latinum but in a wealth of experiences and friends.

The bodged-together nature of the ship and her crew is thus very much in the tradition of Trek, being about overcoming differences while celebrating individual uniqueness and working together to form a whole. Through their eyes we'll also get a look into day-to-day civilian life both out in space and planetside, a perspective often missed in high-flying Trek.

Our Captain is a former member of the Romulan elite, fallen on hard times. Once the captain of a Valdore-type warbird, she acquired the Pioneer after the Supernova and spent most of her remaining assets to do so. The ship is not just her command, but her home, and we first meet her in the process of 'selling/leasing' the ship's deed to Towards Dawn, a necessity brought about by being unable to keep up Pioneer's operating costs on her own, while also being unwilling to leave a ship that has become her home of over a decade, her safe anchorage during trying times. She is now benefitting from being part of a larger enterprise that can provide funds to properly maintain and crew the ship, still but chafes somewhat at going from being the absolute master of her destiny to an owner-employee in a larger co-operative. She'll come around in time, but her overall arc will examine (among other things) finding a balance between individual liberty/freedom and collective responsibility to a greater community/society/crew.

The new First Mate put aboard the Pioneer by Towards Dawn would ideally be an ironic counterpoint to the Captain - perhaps a former enemy like a decommissioned Starfleet officer, or a Reman, a race previously looked down-upon by Romulans. Either way, the new First Mate quickly becomes an essential figure in the Captain's life, both as her subordinate and as a friend.

And so with the Pioneer now fully paid-up, crewed and made ready for sea, she casts off into the Final Frontier, no doubt bound for many adventures. They won't be saving the galaxy but will be fighting for their living and sticking up for the smaller voices in a very big universe, and maybe getting involved in the fringes of the 'bigger picture' along the way.

*

Like I said, just a thought experiment, but I think a pretty compelling one for a Trek series that goes in a different direction and gives us a different viewpoint, while still taking us on episodic adventures to worlds both familiar and unknown, following a small crew facing down the wonders and oddities of the Galaxy and trying to make a living in the heart of it all.

Just watched Voyager for the first time and loved the ending,"\*Spoilers if you haven't seen it\*

I've seen a lot of one-off comments over the years of Endgame and how it was disappointing so I was prepared to be let down but I really like it and here's why.

It was clever how the glimpse we got of the crew back home was in the beginning of the episode and not the end. Then the momentum carried to the very last scene.

Future Janeway being more cynical makes sense... that happens to people as they age when they've accumulated some heavy life events. And then her arc was rediscovering her old self who wasn't like that. And I like that it actually tied to drinking coffee which up until that point was more of a a lighthearted thing.

Current Janeway's arc was incredible too, she would rather save lives by destroying the Borg array than take the easy way out.

Future Kim is a captain and finally not an ensign anymore and present Kim gives that incredible speech about ""The Journey"" rather than the destination.

Paris and Torres finally have the baby, Neelix gets a nod and they follow up on Seven's crush on Chakotay.

The Doctor steals every scene he's in like always.

And I like the fact that it's a crazy ride that just ends, it would have been anticlimactic or rushes to suddenly have a reunion montage... we got to see the journey, not the destination :)",1644729126,startrek,0.5994

Short SceneFlash Fiction A Klingon Doctor,"The Klingon struggled against the restraints that held him to the bed, letting out a few curses in his native language, ending with a stern “You should have let me die.”

The doctor paid no attention to the patient’s outrage.

“What glory? What honor? Is there in THIS?” the patient yelled again, pulling at the chains with the strength of decades of combat.

The doctor finally turned around to address her patient.  “Glory? Honor?” she finally responded.  “When I publish my results, more people in the galaxy will know my name then know yours, General.  When a warrior like you is victorious in battle, they sing songs about you.  When a doctor like me wins, people want to talk to us.  You are invited to drink.  I am invited to teach.  I challenge you, General, which is the greater honor?”

“It is a disgrace to die like this.  Let me die in battle!  Like a warrior!  Not like some experiment.”

“I am a healer, General.  I do not intend to let you die at all.  A Klingon does not surrender anything to the enemy.”

The General seethed in silent rage for a time, before the doctor interrupted him.  “Tell me, General, in your greatest triumph, how many did you kill in battle?”

The General answered in a moment.  “427.  A group of Romulans were trying to invade an outpost.  They were no match for Klingon weapons and Klingon will!”  He jerked the chain, trying to bring his to his chest.  “Qa’Plah!”

“427, using a ship that you did not build, using weapons you did not make.  You only pulled a trigger, yet you claim all of the glory as yours.”

If looks could kill, the doctor would have died in that instant.

“And I have gone to battle with millions, using a weapon that I have created.  This enemy, like yours, invaded Klingon territory and tried to take it for its own.”

“Hah! Millions, Doctor? Millions? Even for a Klingon you exaggerate too much!”

The doctor just pressed a button when a computerized voice announced.  “Eight hundred, thirty seven million, nine-hundred seventy-six thought, four hundred twelve compromised cells found.”

The General returned to his look of absolute anger.

“I realize this is new for you, General, but today you are not the warrior.  You are not the victim.  You are simply the battleground.”",1644715952,startrek,0.0
DS9 podcastyoutube channel the 7th rule hosted by Cirroc Loften Jake Sisko,"I see a lot of buzz and discussion around the delta flyers podcast but never hear anything about the 7th rule so I thought I'd raise awareness.

The 7th rule was a podcast youtube channel started by Aaron Eisenberg (Nog), Cirroc Loften (Jake Sisko) and Ryan T Husk (their friend) and they do weekly reviews of every episode of DS9 they are currently on season 6. Tragically Aaron passed away fairly early on in this channels life (around season 2) But Ryan and Cirroc decided to continue the podcast and honour Aaron's legacy.

The show frequently have actors from star trek appear on it for both interviews as well as episode discussions, for instance they had Nana Visitor on the show while discussing Duet and Andrew Robinson on the show when discussing The Wire. They also feature writers and directors for episodes in their discussions as well.

It doesn't just end there though they also review nu trek as well, with Discovery, Picard and Prodigy reviews and discussions the week they air.

The usual upload style is they'll upload a shortened version of their DS9 discussions to youtube (20-30 mins) while having the full discussion on their patreon and after 3-4 weeks they uploaf the full discussion to their youtube. Their most recent full review being the Magnificent Ferrengi.

Why I dont enjoy bingewatching TOS too much of a product of its time,"Let me preface this:  I love Star Trek, I love the original series, and I love all of the actors that come from it.  Star Trek was and is a visionary masterpiece of sci-fi and nothing will ever take away how progressive and instrumental it was to the cultural zeitgeist.  

That being said, I don't know whether its the fact that it's campy 60s television, with all of the design and social quirks that come with it, but I just can't binge and enjoy it like I can other series.  I can take it in small doses, maybe one or two episodes at a time, but after its game over.  

To me, the weird flowy uniforms, especially the gold trim on Kirk's shirts, how everything looks really plasticky, and how the future seems so strange.  I get that that kind of retro-futuristic idealism is both a product of its time and Roddenberry's original Utopian visions of how the Star Trek universe should be, but to me it is just too far removed from things to feel like it could be the future of the Earth.  Enterprise, surprisingly, suffers from this the least.  Say what you want about the series as a whole, but the fact that things seemed realistic, that people ""remembered"" what life was like before Utopia, things with like home cooking and going out in the grass were common pastimes, not relics of the past.  I'm currently watching the Past Tense episodes of DS9, and this is the connection that I find modern Star Trek handles well, connecting the Utopian view of the future as a hard fought gift that brought us from the past, not just the status quo.  In interviews, actors and those close to Roddenberry said that his vision of Star Trek was that all of these problems had been solved already.  But as Enterprise, DS9, the Original Series cast movies, and even some parts of TNG, with its 80s-90s beige Enterprise which I despise, still made things seem realistic.  TOS stands as a neat image of the future, but not a realistic one, which makes it to me like impressionist paintings, colorful and pretty, but headache inducing to stare at for long periods of time.",1644703763,startrek,-0.3875

Star Trek The Original Series Production Order episode 6  The Naked Time,"Hey.
These are my thoughts on The Naked Time in my TOS re-watch.
This episode showcases part of why my favorite characters are my favorite characters.
First off, Sulu.
If this was any other show at this time, Sulu would have had a katana instead of a fencing foil.
I believe John DF Black actually gave George Takei the choice of using or not using a katana.
Seeing Sulu go crazy with the fencing foil is a reminder that, while Sulu may not have that much depth to him, this little detail shows that Sulu is a character that represents Asian people without being a stereotype, which would have been near unheard of in 1966.
Also, it would have been awesome if George went onto play a campy swashbuckler character.
So much potential.
Moving onto Spock.
Intoxicated though he may have been at the time, this is the first time we start to see some of the real Spock.
Also, it would have been rare for a male character to cry in a show from 1966.
The way he keeps stammering about his duty actually reminds me of my own thought process.
"" I don't care about my duty. I don't care about what I have to do. I just want to be me. ""
This is what Spock would have been thinking and I have thought along those same lines myself.
I'm autistic.
Since I'm autistic, I have to blend in with my neurotypical, or NT, counterparts by downplaying my autistic qualities which is quite exhausting.
Obviously, Spock isn't on the spectrum but there's a lot of overlap between having to downplay these autistic qualities of mine and Spock having to hide his emotions from his Vulcan peers.",1644689477,startrek,0.3182

Star Trek needs less logic and more crying  a take that forgets pre Disco Trek,"I just read this article on polygon:

[https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions](https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions)

I haven't hidden my distaste for Discovery and Picard, but I also like to try and keep an open mind, and understand what I might be missing. This article however makes some pretty strong claims that at least to me don't seem to hold up if you're familiar with original Star Trek or if you disagree with any of the philosophy underlying the points.

First I strongly disagree with the premise that we should be emotional over logical as a guiding principle. Today's world seems to be that world where emotions and gut feelings override facts and logic in many parts of public life. Is the current world ""the best world"" the polygon writer can imagine, the one we should hold up for emulation? Well, job done then, and why bother with speculative fiction...

Second the idea that there was no emotion guiding characters in Trek before Discovery or something... They mention City on the Edge of Forever. Did they think it would have been a better outcome if they listened to their emotions in the moment and saved Keeler? Even emotionally the alternative seemed devastating if you go 5 minutes on and realize you just lost your world and friends etc. 

And they seem to completely miss the non logical, arguably emotional actions of Kirk in The Apple or Space Seed. Kirk didn't have a logical reason to break the society of The Apple. And certainly not an emotional basis to say to Kahn - I respect you even though you're a horrible person who tried to take over the ship, so I will go super easy on you and just exile you to a planet rather than take you to jail.

It's not even that OG Trek pushed logic over emotion - clearly TOS was about the balance between Spock as logic and McCoy as emotion. THis seems like yet another person who read the cliff notes of Star Trek before Disco and basically makes stuff up. I don't even know where the polygon writer got the ""popular conception"" that Star Trek was about logic over emotion.

And furthermore - even if you buy that a product of the times needs to be focused on people's emotions - Disco and Pic never ""deal with them"". No one is in therapy, no one seems to consider how to deal with conflicting emotions from different characters (in fact, in Disco S2, the Burnham and Tyler emotional ""issues"" were dealt with by trying to suppress them IIRC), and as far as exploration of emotions impacting life - Disco seems to top out at ""Let's Cry"". 

The dismissal of philosophy, as slap dash as it might have been as ""fundamentally a logical argument"" with regard to The Measure of a Man also seems misguided. They feel that an episode I haven't seen, ...But to Connect is a better or more modern take on the same theme - because it's based on empathy. The issue is - this point of view IMO is how we get biased outcomes that we're trying to deal with in the US today. If you define who is a person based on how you feel empathy for them - this is how we ended up with so much discrimination today. This method would lead to ""Devil in the Dark"" re-affirming the miners point of view because they *don't* feel like the Horta is a person. Of course the other issue is they don't mention if anyone on the show ""felt"" the opposite of Staments, nor how one ought to resolve such conflicting feelings. 

""The goal of the debate isn’t to comb through legal proceedings, but to allow the participants to have their feelings recognized and validated. ""

This is all somewhat interesting - but seems to lead to no resolution - once we've recognized people's feelings, must we validate them always? Sometimes people feel things that aren't valid in the situation. And even if the feelings are validated - this doesn't resolve a debate - very rarely in fiction or the real world are circumstances that lead to a debate that no one has figured out how they feel outside of rom com's maybe. 

Let's take the Klingon war in S1 of discovery - Even if the Federation had recognized and validated the Klingon's feelings that the Klingons wanted glory, war, and to crush the Federation as a way to unite the empire - and the Klingons took on board the Federation wanted to be friends - what does that do for the situation? If the Klingons want to use the Federation as a way to unite the empire, to feel strong and impactful again as a galatic power - they don't care that the Federation doesn't want a war. And their cultural feelings won't be satisfied without that war. Discovery contradicts itself I guess.",1644678124,startrek,-0.5256

1 year of Trek a newbies perspective,"One day browsing the playstation store i discovered a free to play game called Star Trek Online, as a massive game sci-fi lover &amp; cheapskate I took the plunge &amp; began playing. Not long later i was hooked STO scratched the most of the itches  that i was missing from games at the time BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT ANYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT. For context i had never seen a single episode of star trek (other than that futurama episode) I had seen the jj Abrahms movies &amp; enough memes to know two things KAHHHN &amp; WORF and so i thought i didn't need to see this soap opera in space but the game changed that and i decided to begin watching the entire franchise and if i didn't like it i would stop watching &amp; end the expirement. Long story short I've gone from TOS to DS9 currently watching Voyager alongside Discovery. Each show has their own strengths &amp; weaknesses but for the most part each show is the same (decent to weak writing/ a just fine cast with one maybe 2 superb actors). I would like to share a brief thought on each show below.

TOS- awesome theme song. Doesnt age well in someplaces. NO ONE DOES ANYTHING BUT KIRK OR SPOCK! 
ENT- Terrible theme song. Cut to short. Are we sure this wasn't a Quantom Leap?
TNG- Top Notch cast. READING RAINBOW. Clearly the Data show which was never fully capitalized on narrativly speaking. Why must you torture Worf?
DS9- Sisko wallet probably says Bad MotherFucker on it. Why must you torture O'Brien? Why must you torture worf &amp; O'Brien?
VOY(still in review) Janeway talks like a 1920s socialite &amp; that amazes me.
Disc-  Too rushed why is there no filler episodes? That whole ship is suicidal before &amp; after pikes arrival
Picard - somebody played Mass Effect &amp; was inspired (loosly) Good stuff tho.

Whats your explanation for Tuvok In Unimatrix Zero giving his birthdate as stardate 38774,"I'm betting most people will go with ""In his assimilated state he was prone to errors such as these""",1644653771,startrek,0.34
Rikers PTSD,"The idea popped up in ""The Best of Both Worlds"" that Riker was afraid of the Captain's Chair and that is why he had turned down three commands (the Aries in ""The Icaris Factor', the Melbourne in ""The Best of Both Worlds"" and in ""The Arsenal of Freedom"" he says that he turned down a command to serve on the Enterprise as First Officer).  I think he knew he wasn't ready for command and took the position of First Officer to learn under a different captain how to command before accepting his own command, not wanting to just be a captain, but wanting to be the best captain possible.

Until Picard was assimilated by the Borg and Riker was field promoted to Captain.  While in command of the Enterprise, the first thing he did was order Worf to fire on the Borg cube with their new weapon in an attempt to destroy that ship.  Riker later tells Guinan that he tried to kill Picard, something that Guinan shoots down ""No, you tried to kill whatever they turned him into.""  

Until the events of 'The Best of Both Worlds', Riker is presented as a competent officer and commander.  While yes, the events of ""The Samaritan Snare"" doesn't paint him in the best light (and honestly, no one looks good in that episode), Riker, before that, is able to reconnect the Enterprise in ""Encounter at Farpoint"", gets infected but doesn't sub come to the illness in ""The Naked Now"", knows that Kozinski is full of shit in ""Where No One Has Gone Before"", holds in own on a Klingon Bird of Prey in ""A Matter of Honor"", is a decent opponent to Picard in ""Peak Performance"",  and is able to command the Enterprise in ""Captain's Holiday"" without incident.

After the destruction of the Borg cube and Picard's return from assimilation, Shelby tells Riker that soon he will be offered another command, but we don't see it happen for over 10 years until he takes command of the Titan.  Why?  What if the events of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" rattled him or scarred him into not wanting to take command?  Or what if those events made him a worse officer?  Could he have been suffering from PTSD and no one has ever really mentioned it?

When he takes the captain's chair next, it is in the episode ""Final Mission"" where he is struggling to deal with a garbage pod.  He is the reason why the Enterprise almost falls into enemy hands in ""The Game"".  He takes command in ""Rascals"" only to lose the ship to Ferengi.  Comparing Riker in the first three seasons of TNG, against the last 4 seasons, we see a weaker Riker, an officer who's not as good as he once was.

This is why in the events of ""Chain of Command"", Riker is passed over for captain, in favor of Captain Jellico.  Jellico is quick to point out that Riker really isn't captain material and it isn't long until Captain Jellico relieves him of duty.  Riker isn't the same top-quality officer he was before his encounter with the Borg.  Having to give the order to kill Picard affected him.  Having to command the Enterprise during a combat situation and giving the order to ram the Enterprise into the Borg cube, seeing the ship graveyard at Wolf 359 and seeing the ship that he was offered to command, the Melbourne, adrift in the wreckage, got to him.  

This may also be why he is in command of the Titan, a small ship that only has to worry about Pakleds and not much else.  He doesn't have to worry about going through what Picard did.  The Pakleds aren't going to assimilate him.  

Worse is that Riker's PTSD went unnoticed.  Troi was concerned about Picard's recovery, and then there is Barcley to deal with.  Later she had to focus on Geordi's therapy after his time being programmed by the Romulans.  All anyone noticed was Riker's drop in job, performance, leading Starfleet to not offer him a command.",1644653056,startrek,0.0
Its still insane to me that we are getting a new Star Trek episode a week every week for the next two years minimum,"Think about that for a moment?

Remember (if you were old enough) when Enterprise ended and there was a thought we may not get a show for a few years, if not decades as some were predicting back then.  When the first Kelvin movie was announced, it was definitely great! A big budget Star Trek film with all the bells and whistles. Even if you weren't sold on it all, it was definitely an exciting time to see Star Trek reemerge again. But it still wasn't the same as having a TV show. At least not to me.

And we got 3 films in a 7 year period which amounted to about just 6 and a half hours of content. (ugh) And we're still waiting for the *next* one nearly six years on. (double ugh!)

For fans, beggers can't be choosers but I missed just having ONE Star Trek show on and at least 6 months worth of stories every year. When we got two shows, TNG and DS9 and then DS9 and VOY, it was great. I never complained. It was nuts knowing two shows were on the air together for 7 years straight!

So when Discovery was announced, it felt good, really good! I did suspect we would get another show after that one, but I was thinking five years down the line. Once Picard was announced, right after the first season of Discovery, that's when things started to feel different and that Star Trek was finally coming back in a big way. 

And now, we will have officially 5 shows this year once SNW starts. And there is just so much freaking Star Trek coming our way, it’s insane. Even right now, when you just add up the stuff we know coming this year along with all the shows recently renewed for future seasons, if everything goes as planned, you know how many episodes that will be?

**105 episodes!**

That’s coming just in the next two years. It really feels like the 90s again but bigger since those shows still took tons of breaks and didn’t air all year. These shows are guaranteed to give us a new episode every single week through February of 2024. Even if you don't like all of the shows, chances are you like some of them, so everyone will have something to look forward to! And if things go the way I'm sure Viacom and fans hope, we could have a new weekly episode for 5+ years on!

For me, I can't ask for anything more....except maybe another show. ;D",1644651048,startrek,-0.4574

In Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan I always wondered where the bit of damaged jetpack looking thing on the wall came from Today I finally figured it out,"Here it is! https://i.imgur.com/T12ZFC4.jpg

When Chekhov and Terrell are exploring the remains of the cargo containers from the Botany Bay, there is a bit of something hanging on the wall, a bit of framework with some tanks on it. Literally since I first saw this film in the 1980's I have wondered where it came from, it obviously looked like a prop from an older movie, just some junk they found in the back of the studio warehouse. A few weeks ago I actually spent some time googling it, and couldn't find any information (and now that I've posted it here, I suspect someone else will find it with a ten second google search, but anyway).

Lately I've been on an old cheesy sci-fi movie kick, I watched one on youtube and it's been recommending others to me ever since. Today it recommended ""Destination Space,"" a 1959 pilot for a TV series that the network never purchased. Right at the beginning, you can see the same prop appear on screen, in its original form!

I couldn't be more pleased, just such a random thing I've been wondering about for literally decades, and I recognized it immediately when it showed on screen! I just wanted to share it with others, thinking maybe there are others like me who have not seen it.

For context, some youtube links - [here is a scene where you can see the prop behind Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OofMJ6cwzLM&amp;t=35s), and [here is the link to the ""Destination Space"" pilot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_dUxw0BdMQ)",1644646545,startrek,-0.4404
Did Picard violate the Prime Directive,"So my girlfriend and I just got done watching the Star Trek TNG episode Identity Crisis. The one with the aliens that show up under a black light and reproduce by a parasite that transforms the host. 

At the end of the episode, once Commander Leighton and Geordie are saved, Picard issues the order to place warning beacons around the planet to warn others not to approach.

Wouldn't that be violating the prime directive then, to prevent a species from performing their natural reproduction cycle? If the species is unable to reproduce, then would the species not die out as a direct result of the Federation's actions?

My gf compared them to the Borg, wondering why it would be okay for these aliens to basically assimilate people in the same manner the Borg do, and yet the Borg are the bad guys.

The ""normal"" interpretation of the final scene is that after the real crew found out about Barclay's holodeck versions of them, Barclay went back into the holodeck to say goodbye to his fantasy crew, said ""End program,"" and walked back into the hallway of the real Enterprise.

My interpretation of the final scene is that the entire episode except for the hallway at the end had been in the holodeck, a program Barclay had designed to play out his humiliation kink fantasy. Having humiliation fantasies seemed to fit with his character. The scenes with the crew as musketeers / a goddess / etc. had been a holodeck-in-a-holodeck (similar to Riker's scenes with the future Enterprise crew in ""Future Imperfect""), and the scenes where the crew discovered Barclay's fantasies about him, humiliating him, were also still in the holodeck. Then, at the end of the episode, Barclay resigned on the bridge of THAT holodeck crew, the one that had caught him in his fantasies. Then he said ""Computer, end program"" and walked out into the hallway of the real Enterprise. I assumed that the ""holodeck-in-a-holodeck"" reveal was a twist ending, and that's why the entire episode was about Barclay's fantasy life, his ""Hollow Pursuits.""

The way I understood the episode certainly makes it a more avant garde episode, but I don't think it's any weirder than ""Future Imperfect,"" so I can't quite convince myself I'm wrong!",1644609592,startrek,0.0

Brainstorm Idea Turning the Star Trek roleplaying campaigns Shield of Tomorrow and Clear Skies into animated shows a la Amazons The Legend of Vox Machina,"Hello!

To those who don’t know, Critical Role, a fun roleplaying group that was formerly affiliated with Geek and Sundry, was taken up by Amazon to turn their D&amp;D adventures into The Legend of Vox Machina – an animated production that has seen a lot of critical success.

Out of Geek and Sundry came a roleplaying scenario based on the Star Trek Adventures RPG system by Modiphius: Shield of Tomorrow, which is the tale of the Interpid-class starship U.S.S. Sally Ride. After that finished, the group migrated over to the channel QueueTimes to do Clear Skies, which follows the journey of the starship U.S.S. Ross.

While these two productions were smaller than the legendary Critical Role, they both were run by passionate Trekkies and have ties to other productions – Star Trek Online added the U.S.S. Sally Ride as an unlockable Admiralty card ([https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/U.S.S.\_Sally\_Ride](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/U.S.S._Sally_Ride)) and the U.S.S. Ross is purchasable as a Legendary Galaxy-class starship variant ([https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary\_Ross\_Command\_Exploration\_Cruiser](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_Ross_Command_Exploration_Cruiser)). 

On top of that, Bonnie Gordon, who was the Bajoran Ensign Lark Sage in Shield of Tomorrow and the Caitian Dr. M'Qrell on Clear Skies, is a part of the Kurtzman-era Star Trek shows as the Protostar’s computer on Star Trek: Prodigy: [https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bonnie\_Gordon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bonnie_Gordon).

So what do you guys think, especially those who followed these campaigns? I think it would be a good idea for a few reasons:

\-It cashes in on the success of The Legend of Vox Machina as a roleplaying-focused animated show. The reviews are in and there is a market for such things from the masses.

\-It brings more material that line up with the canon of the current timeline. Shield of Tomorrow takes place during the 2370s (Gowron’s declaration of war is mentioned in the plot as well as the destruction of the Odyssey to the Dominion) and Clear Skies takes place a few years after Voyager returns from the Delta Quadrant: the 2380s.

\-It is filled to the brim with passionate Trekkies who did very well in their roles. Side characters can get additional voice actors – something they did with The Legend of Vox Machina.

\-It gives Paramount + more ready-made Star Trek material since the campaigns are done. All that is left is to animate them to bring the tales to life. The fact that the production will be animated can help the live-action shows continue to work as this production is on-screen – no dead time and more Trek on the streaming system.

\-It occupies a unique type of animated show for Kurtzman-era Star Trek – one that is less childish than Prodigy and more serious than Lower Decks. Both campaigns are more in line with the classic Berman-era shows, so more space adventure overall. 

\-The productions already have ties to existing Star Trek products, most notably the MMO Star Trek Online and the officially licensed Star Trek Adventures RPG book. The tie-ins will further increase profit for a multitude of Star Trek products.

All in all, I think it is a win-win for everybody involved.

They play it for jokes, but it’s just annoying. 

Quark - now that’s how you do comic relief; his appearance in the pilot was a sad reminder of what we would be missing out on in Voyager. 

Plus, nobody likes to see the biggest dork on the ship hook up with one of the hottest crew members. That whole relationship was paternalistic and creepy.

Star Trek Discovery knows Trek needs less logic and more crying  a well written article and one that entirely misses the point,"[https://www.polygon.com/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions](https://www.polygon.com/22924014/star-trek-discovery-character-emotions)

This is a nicely written article. The author references many different scenes from all the different trek series. And yet entirely misses the main point I think.

I have more or less enjoyed every trek series that has come out. I know the main character names in every series. Discovery is the first series where I don't remember all the names because to me, there's not much difference between the characters. At this point I watch it partly out of hope it will become star trek, and partly just to get it out of the way so I can watch something else.

Before I go any further, let me just say that if YOU enjoy discovery, that's totally fine. I'm not offended by someone else enjoying something I don't particularly like. I'm not trying to attack anyone who likes it. But I do wish the show would become better/more interesting, at least in how i define better/more interesting.

The problem for me, and I have a feeling for a lot of Discovery's detractors, isn't that it has feelings. It's that it ONLY has feelings. The author in the article is making the argument that we need feelings to save the day instead of logic. And yes, having some passion about things can definitely lead to heroic moments. But you need logic behind that.

(Some mild spoilers ahead)

Case in point - when they are discussing what to do about the ships computer. In the end they decide to destroy the kill switch on the computer. To me that makes no sense, at all. They have effectively given an alien creature that they barely know complete and total control over the ship, and all the lives of every person on the ship. They decide to make her a member of starfleet just by asking - no testing or anything that every other member of starfleet has to go through. No kobayashi maru test for her. We will just go on our positive feelings that the computer won't have some sort of meltdown when faced with an impossible scenario. And realistically speaking, every crewmember on that ship has a kill button - you can pull out a phaser and shoot them. The computer is the only one who is untouchable now.

Another example of feelings running rampant to me was the episode where they were stuck in that void. All of the major characters all had to go on about their childhoods, all in different scenes. 

Any one of those scenes individually would have been fine. But all of the characters spontaneously have to have discussions about their childhood emotions? Not to mention that basically nothing happens at all in that episode that has any bearing at all on the plot. The only thing of any consequence that happens is the computer is finally acknowledged as being aware/alive...by having a story about overcoming childhood emotions.

I like pizza. I really really like pizza. But even I don't want to eat pizza and only pizza. Discovery is like a diet of just eating pizza. All of the characters all have emotional issues to work through. And that's all we really ever see. Any of that in moderation would be good. But all of that all of the time just makes me tired of it. The ONLY reason I am watching discovery at this point is because it has the star trek label on it. If not for that, i'd probably stop watching even in mid-season. And even it being part of star trek is starting to get close to not being reason enough to keep watching.

Honestly, I think they should take the crew of discovery and put them in an entirely different plot. They don't belong on a starship. At the end of the day starfleet is a job, one with military undertones. In no universe can I imagine the crew of any ship acting the way the characters on discovery act.",1644598095,startrek,-0.4952

Canon Connections Discovery 4x08  All In,"- Production Error: When the security officer is confirming for Vance that taking the spore drive 2.0 would require dual authorization, he says that Tarka entered his code at the same time Vance’s was entered, but when doing so it is the wanted poster for Book that shows up on his display.

    - *”Boy, I really hope someone got fired for that blunder.”* - Some dork, probably

- Haz Mazaro is played by Daniel Kash, who previously portrayed the character Duggan in season three’s “Terra Firma, Part 2”.

- Haz claims he’s having a special on Devore scanners. The Devore were introduced in “Counterpoint”, where they would frequently board the Voyager to scan for telepaths while the ship was traveling through their territory. The basic shape of their scanners hasn’t changed much.

    - Tarka claims the scanners *“...couldn’t pick out a Betazoid standing alone in a Nieser cage,”* and as Betazoids are telepathic we can assume the function of the scanners is still sniffing out telepaths. Who or what a Nieser, and why you would want one to be caged (or maybe a cage made of it?) is unclear.

- The *Karma Barge* is hidden by a hologram of some sort of sea serpent. In “If Memory Serves” the Talosians used an illusion of a black hole to warn interlopers off from their world.

- Haz is the sort of person who always has a saying for every situation. And though a lot of those sayings border on indecipherable, he does mention some familiar references.

    - *“I heard we had Starfleet guests so I just had to scurry like a spider cow to welcome you.”* Boimler and Mariner did have a close encounter with a large spider creature that farmers were using to milk in “Second Contact”. Whether or not Haz intended to just gum on the Starfleets before he recognized Burnham isn’t made explicit but I think we can assume that to be the case.

    - *”I have missed you like a Cardassian misses cake.”* We’re all familiar with Cardassians of course, but I don’t remember an particular reference that would indicate they like ‘em thicc.

    - *”It’s true what the Elasians say, give a man a tor-bak and you are warm in the desert.”* The Elasians are from “Elan of Troyius”.

    - *“What in the katterpod and Calaman sherry is going on here?”* A katterpod is a type of Bajoran mushroom with a variety of food uses mentioned several times over the course of DS9, and Data ordered a Calaman sherry while on a date in “In Theory”. How are they related? Only Haz and the smiling Koala know.

    - *“While you two were strutting around like Klingons in a disco….”* Of course we haven’t seen any Klingons in Disco since the season three finale.

    - *”Act like an Armus….”* The villain of “Skin of Evil” who murdered Tasha Yar for no other reason than that he could.

- *”Uhm, Hugh, the ship cleans for us,”* Stamets points out, echoing a fact established by  Riker in “Up the Long Ladder”. Personally I was not expecting Doctor Culber to snap back, “Well good for the bloody ship,” or the foot bath that followed.

- Burnham cuts a promo declaring Owosekun as *”The Most ferocious fighter this side of Felton Prime,”* referencing a planet where General Martok executed a successful sneak attack against a Cardassian base during the Dominion War, as recounted in “Once More Unto the Breach”.

- Booker and Tarka are able to uncover that the cheater who’s been plaguing Haz is actually a Changeling.

- The species we see the Changeling imitate while it moves throughout the *Karma Barge* are:

    - Xindi-Insectoid

    - A yet unnamed species we’ve seen before this season

    - Human

    - Tribble

    - The humanoid form Changelings assume when dealing solids

- Tarka repurposed the Devore scanner to emit a forcefield to trap the Changeling cheat. In “A Fistful of Datas” Worf was able to jury rig a personal forcefield out of his combadge.

- Haz decides that Burnham, Book, and two Emerald Chain goons who want the isolynium should all play poker to see who gets it. This is the first time poker’s been mentioned on “Discovery”, but it’s an especially popular game across Trek. Bones once offered to teach it to Spock in “The Corbanite Maneuver”; Jake Sisko did teach the game to Nog, as mentioned in “Progress”; Chakotay, Paris, Kim and Neelix had a game interrupted by the arrival of a Borg cube in “Collective”; Hoshi revealed to trip that she once broke a CO’s arm over a dispute that arose from a game; and the senior staff of the *USS Cerritos* has a regular game, but they’re all terrible, as seen in “Moist Vessel”

- Haz’s backroom has a number of weapons on the wall, including a “Discovery” style Klingon mek’leth, last seen season two’s “Point of Light”.

- Haz’s cards have some familiar faces painted on them.

    - Queen of Spades - the unnamed species with a cranial shell from the party at the end of “Beyond”

    - Queen of Diamonds - Arcadian

    - King of Diamonds - Cardassian

- Burnham guesses correctly that Species 10-C might be using the DMA to harvest boronite, an element that according to “The Omega Directive” the Borg used to synthesize a single omega molecule, which on its own would have contained the same amount of energy as a 24th century warp core.",1644578664,startrek,0.0

Startreks ranks system seems to make no sence,"So it seems that the rank and comand system seem to make little to no sence. 

In one episode of one show you have Ensigns who are treated like an Ensign should and then next thing you have Ensigns as senior staff.  

Not to mention the whole nightshift nothing happens so Jr officers can comand.  It's space things have equal chance of happening at any time. 

Like if I were to write a sci-fi story about an organization like startrek,  I would have a captain,  xo, shift commanders for each shift,  department lead and a shift lead for each department for each shift.  

Department heads would be Lt commanders.
Shift leads full Lt.
Shift commanders should Commanders
XO probably add a new rank of Sr commander or Jr captain. 
And captain.  It creates a much more organized comand structure.  

1 captain 
1 xo
3/4 commanders  depending on shift rotation 
Science, medical, security, tactical, engineering  each get a department lead . And 3/4 shift leads. 
If you can have a shift that the xo and the department heads run cutting down the number a bit.  You can also  combine security and tactical if you like .

So assuming you do use the xo and department heads to cut down the numbers a little  we can get down to.

1 captain 
1XO
2/3 commanders
4 department heads 
And 8/12 shift leads. 

But that gives us a Sr staff of 6 and then each department has its own Sr officers of 3 or 4.  Now give each shift lead a specialization if you like . Not going to get into that.

Did the ElAurans know about the Nexus as a species or did the survivors just randomly encounter it Spoilers,"Rewatching Generations for the first time in years I always had a theory but now not so sure.

The survivors forced the transports to fly into the ribbon to go back because after the loss of their world that was the only way to escape that reality, go back to a time before the Borg. How Soren knew he could get back in by being on a high enough point to be ""pulled"" inside, I figured on their homeworld the ribbon similarly came close enough to get inside, he just had to recreate that on another planet. Not that it took Soren 70+ years to figure out how to return, but that the ribbon only travelled through the galaxy once every 70 years and it was something the El-Aurans waited and planned for.

But now, Im thinking maybe they just randomly encountered it, if time has no meaning inside, maybe Guinan, Soren, and the rest learned about the Nexus enough even though it only seemed like minutes in our reality.

I guess it adds to the mystery of the El-Aurans if it was something they knew about. If it was just random it almost just seems dumb or at least not special.

Did anyone else have any theory or thoughts or anything? I'd be curious to hear from other fans.",1644548355,startrek,0.0
Anyone notice the wig issues on Discovery,"I was watching season 4, episode 8 tonight and noticed the wigs on many of the female characters were really bad in this episode. The two black characters looked like they had hats made out of hair (almost as if the wig department didn’t know how to make a wig for a black person) and the President’s lace was coming up on the sides and the entire front was caked with foundation. With shows being shot in such high definition, this stuff becomes very visible.

IMO true Star Trek fans know that the best way to appreciate Star Trek is to make fun of it together 😋

Watching DS9 and now I feel bad for Ensign Kim,"After the devastating news that I couldn’t rewatch voyager again on Netflix I rewatched DS9 and seeing Nog (one of my favorite characters) being promoted to lieutenant and realizing that poor ensign Kim (not one of my favorite but still) did not get promoted is almost worse than being next to Paris going from convict to lieutenant back and forth a few times since Nog started as child who couldn’t read, went to the academy and still beat out Kim for a promotion. Granted there was a war on but still don’t understand why they would write into the show someone who’s competent not being promoted after 6 years. Seemed pointlessly mean to one character for no real reason and didn’t really add the plot.",1644536417,startrek,-0.5423
Updated more personalized Kobayashi Maru,"I have a hard time accepting that a test like the Kobayashi Maru would remain static for over a century. Surely Starfleet Academy gets an in-depth psych profile on all applicants which is updated as the cadets progress, right? And there’s also the fact that people talk about things and share experiences like “here’s what killed me in under a minutes” or “here’s how I dragged that bastard out for an hour”. Then there’s the fact that three D7 cruisers are going to feel pretty dated. So there have to be multiple starting elements that use info from the cadets’ psych profiles to create unique (or nearly unique) simulations every time.

That said, what do you imagine would have been unique Kobayashi Maru scenarios for various TNG or later officers?",1644535434,startrek,0.0

So finally watched Picard Season 1 And is it just plainly obvious to everyone else that the galactic thread is EXACTLY THE SAME AS MASS EFFECT,"I know I'm incredibly late to the party on this and I'm sure this connection has probably already been talked to death. But, like, c'mon!!!

* In the (relatively) recent past a synthetic race had an uprising
* They've been made illegal and vanished (assumed gone entirely by some)
* They've reappeared
* In the ancient past a synthetic race wiped out its creators
* They are now incredibly powerful and hiding outside the galaxy
* They are waiting to be summoned by a new synthetic race
* The recent synthetic race are attempting to contact the ancient synthetic race
* If they succeed they will wipe out organic life in the galaxy

Of course the particulars are different. But still.

Now, just to note, I played Mass Effect 1 when it was new, and never played any sequels. I'm replaying the first now as part of the Legendary edition.",1644511309,startrek,0.0

I have finally watched DS9 from start to finish,"DS9 was around when I was in my 20's. I loved TOS and TNG but for some reason I never got into DS9. I had only seen an episode here and there but never took the time to watch it all.

So a few months ago I decided to watch the entire series from start to finish, because I had heard it's widely considered the best Trek series among a lot of fans. I was not disappointed.

I can't help but admire how they had an overall story arc already planned out from the start. It was a very long and comprehensive narrative and yet many of the episodes also work as standalone pieces. As someone who once wanted to be a writer, I'm in awe of their ability to tell such a complex long form story.

The cast is stellar. I felt Sisko and some of the others sometimes chewed their scenes a bit but it was never to the point where it ruined things for me. I'm not sure if I can pinpoint who my favorite actor was from a sheer performance standpoint. Rene Auberjonois was superb as Odo, soulful yet distant, exuding utmost competence but yet holding a fathomless loneliness within. He was a man of many burdens, and he carried them with stoic grace.

Nana Visitor also stands out, the conflicted former terrorist that struggles with her role as part of the new government. She endures *so* much but it never breaks her. She weathers the tempest, still standing tall after it's over. She's emotionally the strongest character in the show IMO, never flinching from the truth no matter how much it hurts her.

Thematically it's a very unique story, daring to show a shady side of Starfleet in shocking ways at times, even to where they attempt genocide. The show doesn't hesitate to undermine authority, and to state that sometimes it's necessary to use violence to counter fascism. The show doesn't hesitate to call out imperialism and colonialism, and in a lot of ways the Cardassians represent America far more than the Federation does. It's pretty daring stuff and way ahead of its time IMO.

There were so many fantastic character arcs, from major characters like Worf to minor characters like Damar. I mean Damar started off as Gul Dukat's lickspittle, his Smithers, and yet by the end emerges as such an epic legend.

The humor was often driven by the Ferengi characters, and the actors who played Quark, Rom, and Nog were perfectly casted and up to the task. Of course i couldn't entirely avoid spoilers on a show that had been around for so long, and I had known that Rom was going to become Grand Nagus, but still it didn't ruin the experience for me.

And then for them to cap off the show with what was basically a 10-part story, it was brilliant and some of the best episodes I've ever seen, in *any* show. Tacking Into the Wind was probably my favorite aside from the finale itself, it was glorious.

I have to agree with fans that say it was the best series, it doesn't even come close. TNG may have some of the best individual episodes of all time, but overall you just can't beat DS9 in my book.",1644510488,startrek,0.0

How did you get into Trek What series was your entry point,"For me, it was Star Trek: The Voyage Home.  I was 16 at the time it came out in the theaters.  I knew about Trek, and had seen an episode or two, but was not impressed (I think I saw some bad season 3 ones).  Then a new friend I had made who was a trekkie asked if I wanted to see the movie.  

It was a Friday night 10pm showing and my curfew was at 11pm.  My mother would not let me stay out later and I got annoyed at that since I had not broken any of her rules and never showed an ounce of rebellion.  But I told my friend she was fine with it and at 9pm I snuck out of my room and went to the movies.

Met some great people on line as we waited for the doors to open.  They explained what had happened in the previous 2 movies.  Gave me a list of the best Trek episodes I should rent from the video store.  

When the movie was over, I was amazed.  I loved every moment of it.  We stopped off at a grocery store and I saw the novelization for the movie.  I bought and and went home and started reading it.  By the weekend I was done and on my way to being a super fan.  Over the next few months I consumed everything Trek.  Rented every episode.  Rented the movies, bought the books.  Started to buy the movies and shows when I could afford it.  Made Trek friends.  

Then we got news that there would be a new generation of characters and a new star trek on TV.  My friends all proclaimed that Trek was Kirk, Spock and McCoy and anything else was ""not trek"".  

But we all know how that turned out.  

Since then I have seen every episode of trek, read the books and all the comics.  I am still a super fan.

Also my mom totally realized I had snuck out and didn't ground me, but let me know this was the one and only time she would tolerate it.  

Can I also say that my reading comprehension skills in school improved greatly becoming an avid reader.  All my teachers were amazed at my improvement.",1644509145,startrek,0.0
