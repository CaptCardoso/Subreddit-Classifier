the idea that   at least the prequels tell a coherent story  is an illusion ,"the prequels tell a story with a known ending   that is what gives them this illusion of a coherency   

    but when you look closer 

the force is suddenly  out of balance    what do they mean by this   this is never explained  nor how this  chosen one  will bring it back into balance 

the jedi s ability to use the force is suddenly diminished   how   why   this is never explained 

in the beginning of aotc the jedi stand up for duku s character when he s accused of being behind the plot to assassinate padme   however  when duku tells them that palps is a sith they completely blow him off  even though they themselves are suspicious of palps  

suddenly its   lies and deceit are duku s ways     but let s go ahead and use the army he obviously created  against him  without question 

then there s mace who says in one moment   the dark side surrounds the chancellor  then a moment later  when anakin tells him palps is a sith  he acts surprised     

of course there s anakin s motivation and turn   its pretty clear that anakin s motivation for turning dark is to save his wife from his  bad dreams  where she dies in childbirth   this is evident in his very words at the moment of his turn   just help me save padme  i can t live without her  

unfortunately  palp s first words here are   to cheat death is a power only one has achieved  but together i m certain we can discover the secret 

so  palps just now admits that he doesn t actually know how to save padme  despite maybe an hour ago  begging anakin to  use my knowledge    the knowledge to save padme     yet anakin still joins him 

now i ve heard countless head canon explanations for all this  but if you have to use head canon to explain a movie  then its clearly not a  logical and consistent  i e   coherent  story ",1646325692,starwars

about luke skywalker,if disney has to bring him back constantly now  at least do something with him instead of doing empire but in reverse  i feel like making the essential star wars main character just cameo fodder and or punching down on him because he apparently makes the very same mistakes as every jedi before him having learned nothing from the past is just gonna make people more salty towards the disney canon  there is so much eu material to adapt here and i m sure not everything about it was bad ,1646324093,starwars

whats your favourite star wars medium ,"i ve seen the fims  tv shows  read books  audiobooked and played force unleashed i  amp  ii 

its difficult to decide for me  as a kid the ot was phenomenal    it was three films which now isnt much  but back then it literally created an entire universe  it seemed like so much content  rotj was particularly good because you coukd watch it  be immersed and then run outside with friends to a garden or grove and be on endor 

i really enjoyed being starkiller in the games when i was older  being vader for the opening sequence jumpstarted my childhood awe anx the games allowed that immersion i had felt as a kid runing around going pew pew pew 

nowadays  all about the audiobooks  i love listening for hours while working  particularly when some paragraph or chapter ties in to well known events and gives it greater context  or even adds elements of subterfuge or hidden sith control  etc ",1646306651,starwars

a love letter to all star wars actors ,"i love star wars  all nine skywalker saga films  anthology tales  shows and shorts have made my life filled with adventure and hope  wishing one day the calling of the force would come to me or if not the adventures you ve all taken me down is a ride i hold very dear 

so this for you star wars actors no matter who you were in the movies from fan favorites to infamous characters  main characters and background extras  light  dark and in between  thank you 

lastly remember no matter how many people say bad things about your portrayal of a character know that to me you brought your all to that character and i not only appreciate all of your yard work but the legacy you ve woven  i want to shout out a few specific people as well who i want to say thank for in polarizing roles  

ahmed best as jar jar  after rewatching phantom menace your acting stands out as expressive and thoughtful  no matter how silly your character was know that jar jar always brightens my day and i have found a new appreciation for the importance jar jar has on the star wars world as a whole 

jake loyde as young anakin  no matter how canned your lines were somehow i really felt as if a kid would say that and as young anakin i truly felt a sense of grand adventure through anakin s young and naive perspective  know that you started a legacy that is fondly remembered and one i grew up loving 

hayden christensen as anakin  i won t toot too much of a horn as the fanbase has grown to what i always enjoyed but know that as anakin even with cringy dialogue to contend with your portrayal of anakin truly shows the raw emotion that anakin fights with  episode 3 has some of my favorite emotional bits and acting of all time and anakin is the forefront of that 

daisy ridley as rey  for the same reasons i love young anakin  rey gives me a great sense of adventure and your truly amazing acting talent shines through as the slowly growing rey  i really hope to see you in another star wars project 

john boyega as finn  hands down my favorite character from the sequels  your acting was a cherry on top for emotional scenes and seeing finn any time on screen was always a treat  they did you dirty in the story department but i know the force is strong with this one 

kelly marie tran as rose  it saddens me rose was swept to the side because despite the role you filled that was destined to be a bomb rose stuck out as someone with an unflinching moral compass that honestly was more grounded than people give her credit for  your acting was full of emotion that as a sibling i could truly feel for her and her ordeal  would be glad to see rose again on screen any time 

this may never get seen by any of the actors mentioned and that s fine  know that if you read this this is my love letter to all who breathed life into a galaxy far far away ",1646296954,starwars

critique my sequel idea,"so this is spoiler free kinda because its basically a fanfic  idk if its against the rules but 
ep7 finn isnt just a trooper  he is an orphaned child adopted by what will become the first order  he has a potent attraction to the force and is claimed to be a candidate to be the right hand of snoke  its a title that several acolytes are striving for but finn is too kind  he was too old when he was kidnapped but his strong gift kept him alive in the ranks  on his first mission we see the savagery of the other acolytes striving to become snokes apprentice  
in front of him sits a young girl and finn suffers visions of a faint memory  watching his parents be killed  he feels her connection to the force  he cant kill her and instead takes her  prisoner   the first order flee because the new republic will be arriving soon but finn stalls his shuttle long enough to turn himself in and escape the darkness  several jedi accompany him in binds to the new republic military base  
finn defects and promises to help them but they cant trust him  instead they give him a short leash to be  free  and keep him in the reclaimed jedi temple on coruscant where luke is the head of the new jedi order  but he had been on a hiatus since an incident involving one of his students  ben solo had fallen to the darkness and saw that the new jedi order was following the same path that had gotten them destroyed before  becoming political  and forcing children to join because they were too dangerous not to be trained  he saw the padawans as almost child soldiers  ben had seen the child slaves of canto byte and tatooine and hutt space but was disgusted that the jedi didn t do anything about it  
so finn is held in the temple when imperial remnants and the first order launch a suicide assault on coruscant faster than the new republic can deploy its forces  bombardments of cannon fire barrage the surface from low atmosphere killing millions  as the temple is destroyed and finn escapes with rey who the current jedi council was testing for membership into the order  we see fighting in the halls of the temple as an unarmed finn and rey run around the hastily assembled militia using old empire uniforms and tech ",1646281956,starwars

question about anakin skywalker and darth vader in the prequel trilogy,"when i watched the prequel trilogy  and the other star wars movies in general  i ve known a fair bit about the plot and characters prior to watching the movies  since i watched the movies pretty late and i ve already heard people talk about the characters or i ve seen them in other media s  like playing some of the games 

so when i watched the 3 prequel films for the first time  i knew that anakin skywalker is darth vader and i was seeing him developing to be him  so it was predictable for me and i already knew the outcome  

my question is  was this the case for the original fans of the series  like when the prequel movies first released and people watched them for the first time did they also know that anakin is darth vader  was it already confirmed through any means such as the comics or games or did the directors of the movie even announce it  

or was it a completely unexpected outcome and it came off as a complete surprise plot twist when anakin became darth vader 

also in the case that it wasn t confirmed and was indeed a surprise plot twist  did many people predict this outcome  like did people feel or expect that he s going to turn out to be darth vader through hints or character development in the story  or was it a huge massive surprise that almost no one knew about 

im asking this because i want to understand the true feelings of the movies  as i said i already knew their outcome so i didn t have that moment of surprise when anakin turned out to be darth vader  

when i watched the sequels i also knew that darth vader is going to turn out to be luke s father  but i know that this part is a surprise and a plot twist judging by the reactions i saw about it  not sure if it s the same case about anakin being darth vader though",1646277235,starwars

i ask because aspyr media has just recently given likes and responded to two people on twitter  one of those people being me  where they were asking aspyr if they would remaster star wars bounty hunter  star wars rogue squadron 1 3  and star wars trilogy arcade  and aspyr said that they would indeed remaster these star wars games  if the demand is there and there s plenty of people that want these sw games remastered  one way to tell them we want these sw games remastered is by giving these two tweets plenty of likes and retweets so aspyr can see that people want these games remastered

if they sleep  eat  and swim in it do they procreate in it  how do they stay clean  how does their hair get cut  how do they use the bathroom  if they get wet and stay in it won t they get a serious rash  on that note  if they get mortally wounded are they just supposed to die  like we saw in the season one finale  it would be extremely difficult to eat anything and an extreme inconvenience  wouldn t it be hot and sweaty like always  and what happens if mando get sick and has to puke  what happens if fire ants get in the suit  i hope you see where i m coming from ",1646266700,starwars

rogue one is the best star wars movie,in my opinion it captures the heart of what star wars is truly about and it is the most down to earth  it feels the most hopeless of them all  but it brings the feeling of hope back to the galaxy far far away  it evokes so many feelings and one of them is sheer helplessness  this film really makes me understand exactly how much the rebel alliance had to go through in order to win  this movie does not shy away from death and it s crazy how everybody dies after playing their part in getting the plans to the rebel alliance  it s an actual war film and it was such a breath of fresh air  i was really rooting for the protagonists  and they won  but at the cost of their lives which is a tough pill to swallow  yet one rooted in everyday life  i m so glad i re watched this  that scene with darth vader is so badass but it really makes you realize what lengths the empire was willing to go to keep those plans from getting out  both sides had heavy death tolls and it makes me think about wars in real life and how many people have sacrificed their lives for the future of their countries  family and friends  in the end  i hope for world peace one day ,1646265259,starwars

why did the clones lose their personality after order 66 ,"i started watching the bad batch recently and this question kept bothering me 

i get the  good soldiers follow orders  thing and how the inhibitor chips keep the clones from disobeying orders  but it seems like after 66 all of the clones become aggressive  generally hostile  and for the most part lose their individual personalities that made them such interesting characters before 

is this just a symptom of them now being  villains  and the fact rhat script writers want to dehumanize them for the convenience of keeping the moral alignment obvious  or is this an actual feature of order 66 ",1646258557,starwars

an open letter to disney  stop what you are doing right now and listen to your fanbase  pay the expanded universe authors what you owe them and make the movies we want to see ,"retcon and destroy all continuity with episodes 7  8  and 9  i am going to go one step further than what the majority of fans have explained  detailed  and have pointed out to you  many of you in the corporate offices may not like what we have to say  but just to let you know  we are tired of the mistreatment of star wars 

you had 30   years or storyline  lore  and plot lines to derive the newer movies from  let s talk about what no one has mentioned  what no one has brought to the forefront   

you had the golden opportunity to adapt these novels  videogame characters  and storylines which were already within the minds of fans  to the vast majority of us  you purchased this to continue the novels and make them into real life films  just because you decided to randomly retcon the entirety of the eu doesn t mean we do not expect it or believe it wasn t going to be filmed  you inadvertently promised us this  whether it was to your knowledge or not  and it was not what we desired  the audience is not happy and will continue to be so  

as things currently stand with this property and franchise  there are fans online who have created movies and films out of passion that are better than your billion dollar laundering scheme  admit it  you made the eu non canon because you saw a golden opportunity to make money  you wanted star wars as a money maker  in purchasing these property rights you forgot to adapt the novels and didn t want to pay the writers who made the blueprint for you  this is why the newer films have no connection and no legacy  there aren t the spiritual successors to anything which came before  they don t show love and passion of a craft  

you failed to make these films and to make them well  

i think you should sell the rights back to george lucas ",1646251591,starwars

here s how i would rewrite kylos fall in tlj ,we start with seeing the fateful night that ben destroys the order  the scene starts with luke having a horrific nightmare brought on by a dark side vergence  he wakes up with a yell of lure terror  sweating and panting  he figures out that the dark side was giving him those visions  and he follows the trail of darkness to bens room  and realizes it s coming from ben  he uses the force to take a peak at what the heck is going on in his mind  and he has the same visions of suffering and destruction and pain that ben will bring  it cuts to snoke  showing that he s channeling hatred and dark sideyness into ben  but he s covering his tracks to make it seem to luke that it s coming from bens own mind  luke sees the horrific visions  and in a moment of shock and terror  staggers backward into a dresser or something  waking ben up  ben is full of anger and hatred from snoke  so he starts a big argument confrontation with luke  as far as luke knows  ben s delving into darkness  and being a disrespectful punk to luke  as a result  stern teacher luke scolds ben like a child  ben loses it  attacking luke with his lightsaber  in the fight  luke is wounded  and the building falls down  ben goes on a rampage  destroying everything  as he wouldn t be thinking clearly later  he learns that snoke was dumping horrific amounts of hatred and anger into an innocent teenagers mind  and he feels immense guilt for not realizing it  he goes to ach to with a handful of surviving students for two reasons  one  to rebuild his order  two  he can t bear to look leia and han in the eye  as he feels partially responsible for what happened  this makes a conflict between luke and ben  makes ben a sympathetic and tragic villain  and lukes character remains intact  it s not perfect  but i think it could work  obviously  tfo and tros would need to change to accommodate this  but i don t think that would be a major loss ,1646251181,starwars

vader s other skirt ,"dont know how many know this  im not the most informed fan so many might and im just out of touch  but in just one scene  as far as i know  in the original trilogy  vader has an alternate battle skirt  this one is shorter and is closed in the front and is only visable in the rotj  it can bee seen on vader in the scene where the rebel group approach endor with the stolen ship and clearance codes  when the camera is focused on piett at the communication console and vader can be seen walking towards him from the observation window in the background it can be clearly seen  as far as i know this is the only time we see this look used 

the thing is  i actually really like that look more  dont know why but i just completes his look a bit better in my mind  more so than the back only skirt  and its look almost gives me the vibe of a mockery of the jedi robes feeling  what are others thoughts on this  did you know or not and which look do you like better

 hot take  did you hate vice admiral holdo  it was probably the dress ,"i ve been on a rewatch lately and the thought occurred to me as i was skipping the scenes with her in it  except of course the one scene with arguably the most satisfactory development in her character arc  

holdo is notorious for being the recipient of a fair share of the fandom s ire  thanks to her sheer unpleasantness and lack of military competence but an oft overlooked element of why she s so disliked is definitely the dress  

let s for a moment set aside her sneering  scowling mug as she dismisses the best pilot in the fleet  or her brain dead tactic of simply not telling anyone what the hell her plan was as the rebels were being shot into oblivion  she s wearing a dress  a goddam ballgown  holdo is supposed to be this war hero  yet for all her alleged military chops  one of which is awareness both on the battlefield and off  perhaps someone neglected to remind her that she isn t going to dinner  but in a leadership position of a desperate ragtag group of rebels  

the utter tone deafness of wearing a fancy eggplant hairdo with a figure hugging number for a  war hero  with the utterly patronizing demeanour that would be at home on an imperial vessel cannot be overstated  she s dressed like an elite  and certainly acts like one  

why the dress  why  mon mothma wore one  but she came from a lineage of politicians and wasn t military  leia was literally a  princess  and even she wore military fatigues  but no  holdo just had to look like she was looking for hors d eouvres rather than an escape 

maybe i m off with this  it s definitely her moronic tactics  or her attempt at out souring a rancor s vomit or maybe it s the dress that earns her the contempt of pretty much everyone  

what i do know for sure  is that it s all of the above ",1646244731,starwars

why wouldn t the jedi just use cybernetics to regulate their emotions ,"the kotor games have item descriptions that suggest cybernetics can have a great deal of influence over your mind  there s things that predict your mental patterns to resist mental attacks  for example 

so  wouldn t cybernetics be perfect for a jedi  surely there s something that could just regulate the hormones responsible for anger  fear  or impulsive decisions  if a jedi felt they were particularly apt to feelings of anger  they could use cybernetics to balance out their emotions  which wouldn t be much different from taking medications  sidenote  do any jedi regularly take medications  never heard of them relying on meds 

i m sure the jedi would prefer to resist it by willpower alone  but it doesn t make sense to never make use of something that could possibly prevent hundreds of jedi from falling to the dark side  of course  i suppose the jedi would probably be against medical treatment for something like depression  they d want to make it into some sort of trial  still though  i think it d be cool if some jedi would augment their focus with implants ",1646242403,starwars

how were force sensitives  regulated  under republic ,"in the original movies  force was sort of a judeo christian concept  you believe in the force   jesus devil    you get nice space magic  

but in the prequels it turned out the force is a biological thing  you have the right bloodline genes cells  you get the force  

so that kind of imply at least a small   of force users will exist in all species  even at 0 001   we should see hundreds of force users on every inhabited world  

at the height of the republics  there were 10 000 jedis in a temple  

how on earth did the jedis regulate force users for example  if mom stopped jedis from taking little timmy for training  then a few years down the road timmy figured out he can use the force to convince the local cheerleader to go on a date with him or blast the bullies with a shock or two

new to star wars,"hey all  i just  discovered  star wars recently  i saw a few when i was real young so i know names like luke and boba fett and jabba and such  

but  with all of the side series by disney and the original movies and this and that and the other thing coming out  i m a bit overwhelmed 

considering all of the movies and series that are released  what is the chronologically correct order to watch the movies and series in so it flows at least somewhat smoothly  i know by starting with the mandalorian i was way off but it was still a great series

attachment in the original saga,"it seems since book of boba came out  the concept of  attachment  has come up more frequently in discussions here  i m not going to spoil anything from the show  but i ve been seeing some major misconceptions from the pre disney material repeated fairly often in these conversations  to start with   

1  anakin was not the    cause    of the order s destruction

this is pretty explicit in the films  even if we get rid of anakin  padme  and anything and everyone ruined by the stench of  attachment   the jedi by the time of the prequels are very much fucked  consider that 

a  in attack of the clones a set of bankers and a disgruntled ex jedi were about to effectively one shot the order until an army of clones inexplicably drops from the sky 

b  that army of clones was literally ordered by someone set on the order s destruction

c  even with that army of clones  they only ever gained an upperhand due to to the excursions of one anakin skywalker and an obi wan kenobi  during the outer rim sieges the six months prior to rots 

d  the jedi only even figured out who  darth sidious  was because anakin told them 

the destruction of the jedi order was brought about by many things  but if there was an induvidual catalyst it was sidious  the only reason the jedi had any prayer of survival was because sidious got  attached  ha  to the idea of taking the most powerful force user in history as an apprentice and maybe there was a genuine paternal craving  who knows   sidious originally planned to be the last and only sith but went out of his way and risked a thousand years of planning so he could walk the sky  the gamble would eventually cost him  but even as of rots  it was anakin s presence that gave the jedi an opening on the chancellor they were too  clouded by darkness  to see  which brings me to the next point

2  why was anakin the chosen one 

it s arguably the most poorly handled aspects of ani s writing in the prequel films  but regardless  anakin was not just some powerful force user the jedi were hoping would come good  this is somewhat implied with his virgin birth  but we get a full backstory with  the story of plagueis the wise   essentially  anakin s  dad  was the force  

in  dath plagueis       sidious and plagueis perform a galaxy wide ritual to force the force to bend towards the darkside at this point the darkside is simply supposed to be a cancer which the force seeks to exterminate  the whole  dark and light must be balanced  concept we ve seen glimpses off in newer material wasn t really a thing      this    is why the jedi keep repeating  the darkside clouds everything  during the prequel films  again  not really a clinic of coherent writing  but this ritual is why the jedi aren t able to sense sidious is palpatine  plagueis and sidious are initially surprised that the force  doesn t put up a fight  when they perform the ritual  later in the novel  right before plagy gets shived by shiv   plagueis realizes that anakin was the force s answer to the aforementioned ritual  in other words he is literally created  by the force  to  bring the galaxy back to balance  by exterminating the sith  he is quite literally  the lightside  given form  sidious kills plagueis before he can learn this  so he ends up  taking a keen interest  in the boy  the point to this detour is that anakin  narratively  is the jedi order s safety net  he s the  break in case of emergency   anakin s own failure or  depending on your point of view  delayed success  in living up to this is both a commentary on his own character defects hubris  obsessiveness  impulsiveness   but it is also a commentary on the state of the order  the jedi were not   doing just fine  they had indeed been doing the opposite of fine and as a result needed a savior  then when the force  the entity that they hold above all else  handed them that savior  they fucked it up  which brings me to my final point 

3  pt jedi policy was not  the norm 

in the 25000 year history of the order  celibacy no love no attachment was only really thing for the thousand years before the prequel trilogy  it was an after math of one of several jedi sith conflicts the jedi had emerged victorious from over the course of their 25000 year history the in universe explanation for why they always eventually won is that the force actively seeks to exterminate the darkside which is why sids and plagy were trying to shift the force s balance in the first place    

this point was also where the maximum age limit for jedi admittance was set  and it goes hand in hand with another major policy shift  the republic not having a standing army   

the common theme with all these things is the jedi decided they needed to minimize risk with conservative policy  it s also important to understand this period was the nadir of the order s glory fitting considering it eventually would mark its end  

 the jedi were at their least populous  it turns out convincing parents to let you kidnap babies isn t as effective for building up numbers as macking and reproducing is   their least popular apathy and kidnapping babies really doesn t lend itself to fans   and their least effective  literally brought to their knees by a bunch of cowardly bankers   meanwhile the senate slowly grew more and more corrupt right under their noses  this is why dooky ends up starting a civil war in the first place   the order itself was prone to shady practice a member of the jedi council actually had multiple concubines   which is all to say  narratively  the jedi we see enacting conservative policy aren t supposed to represent some high and mighty ideal  they represent decadence and complacency  this is portrayed pretty well in the novelization for rots credit to matthew stover   first       pride   

 gt  nine hundred years of study and training  of teaching and of meditation  all now focused  and refined  and resolved into this single moment  the sole purpose of his vast span of existence had been to prepare him to enter the heart of night and bring his light against the darkness 

   

 gt their clash transcended the personal  when new lightning blazed  it was not palpatine burning yoda with his hate  it was the lord of all sith scorching the master of all jedi into a smoldering huddle of clothing and green flesh   
 gt   
 gt a thousand years of hidden sith exulted in their victory 

   

 gt when those blades met  it was more than yoda against palpatine  more the millennia of sith against the legions of jedi  this was the expression of the fundamental conflict of the universe itself  light against dark   
 gt   
 gt winner takes all 

then      the fall   

 

 gt it came when the avatar of light resolved into the lineageof the jedi  when the lineage of the jedi refined into one single jedi   
 gt   
 gt it came when yoda found himself alone against the dark   
 gt   
 gt in that lightning speared tornado of feet and fists and blades and bashing machines  his vision finally pierced the darkness that had clouded the force   
 gt   
 gt finally  he saw the truth   
 gt   
 gt this truth  that he  the avatar of light  supreme master of the jedi order  the fiercest  most implacable  most devastatingly powerful foe the darkness had ever known   just didn t have it     he d never had it  he had lost before he started      
 gt   
 gt   he had lost before he was born     
 gt   
 gt    the sith had changed  the sith had grown  had adapted     had invested a thousand years  intensive study into every aspect of not only the force but jedi lore itself  in preparation for exactly this day  the sith had remade themselves   
 gt   
 gt they had become new   
 gt   
 gt while the jedi   
 gt   
 gt    the jedi had spent that same millennium training to refight the last war     the new sith could not be destroyed with a lightsaber  they could not be burned away by any torch of the force  the brighter his light  the darker their shadow  how could one win a war against the dark  when war itself had become the dark s own weapon 

in history there s a thing called  great man history  where historical consensus overamplifies the role an individual plays in a pivotal event  in the history of the star wars universe  the millenium long decline and  eventually  collapse of a 25 000 year old institution is much too big to lay at the feet of one individual  the jedi s defeat here was the result of everything and everyone  and ultimately  when anakin did do what he was supposed to 30 years late  it wasn t just anakin  it was anakin  and his son  and his son s friends  and a rebellion that was founded before luke or leia even knew what  rebellion  meant  while the prequels are a personal tragedy  they re also an institutional one  what seems to hold true though  at least in the star wars universe  is that love is very powerful  this is obvious enough in return of the jedi  but we see it s other side in revenge of the sith when anakin  now vader  plots to overthrow palpatine 

 amp  x200b 

 gt  he could feel his power growing  indeed  he had the measure of his  master  already  not long after palpatine shared the secret of darth plagueis s discovery  their relationship would undergo a sudden    transformation  

two sentences later   

 gt and yet     
 gt   
 gt he couldn t shake a certain creeping sensation    a kind of cold  slimy ooze that slithered up the veins of his legs and spreadclammy tendrils through his guts     
 gt   
 gt almost as though he was still afraid     
 gt   
 gt she will die  you know the dragon whispered   
 gt   
 gt he shook himself  scowling  impossible  he was darth vader fear had no power over him  he had destroyed his fear   
 gt   
 gt all things die   
 gt   
 gt yet it was as though when he had crushed the dragon under his boot  the dragon had sunk venomed fangs into his heel   
 gt   
 gt now its poison chilled him to the bone   
 gt   
 gt even stars burn out   
 gt   
 gt he shook himself again and strode toward the holocomm   
 gt   
 gt he would talk to his master   
 gt   
 gt   palpatine had always helped him keep the dragon down   

palpatine s true power over anakin was that he offered anakin something the order really didn t  where love is absent  darkness calls  on the other hand 

 gt  the ultimate goal of the sith  yet they can never achieve it  it comes only by the release of self  not the exaltation of self  it comes through compassion  not greed     love is the answer to the darkness     

the ultimate goal referenced  immortality  and it turns out  even i hate sand man can do it

i think i just figured out boba fett s helmet dent ,"so originally as seen in attack of the clones jango s helmet gets dented in the exact same spot by the reek trampling him  you can see the before and after of the helmet when mace first holds a lightsaber to jango s neck and also when his head is cut off and the helmet flies to the ground  it can be hard to see in the early cgi but this is later confirmed in season 2 of clone wars during death trap where jango s helmet is used as bait  

now you might say  well jango s helmet is destroyed during this attack on the side of the dent so how does that work   well what if the dent was not caused by bane dueling boba like in the ambiguous cut season  the main reason being we see cad bane s own blaster bolts bounce off of nova s armour in book of boba fett  but rather an homage to his father as even when he repairs and repaints his armour in mando he keeps the dent  so what if in reforging the helmet of his father and claiming jango s armour as his birthright he embeds the dent as a way of paying the legacy of his father and the event that shaped him into a tangible reminder  furthermore it perfectly represents boba  the clean and honorable legacy of his mandalorian father forever tainted for taking 1 bad job  the debt in armour that could block lightsabers 

lastly if you say that if a blaster bolt couldn t dent the helmet why can a beast  i remind you the din s armour was destroyed by the mud horn ",1646205333,starwars

one more of those posts  my girlfriend watches all of star wars,"so  we have been together for over a year and she had never seen the movies or any related stuff really  of course what sparked her interested was the mandalorian  that i showed her the episodes in order so we could watch together  and with that    little grogu  who the entire fan base knows and love 


coming from that  i told her that we should watch the movies to know what the references are and she was on board 


i m one of those fans who enjoy all of the movies for what they are so i said nothing and just let her have her opinion on everything without interference  i just told her the references that would come up here and there 


we went with the release order because she didn t know about luke s father 


and i know nobody asked but having an outside perspective of the saga is good for this sub  maybe  so here we go 


episode 4  she really liked the movie and found it to be very exciting  she really liked who leia  han and luke became friends quick and she loved the droids  she found vader s breath to be a very imposing sound and that his armor was amazing 
  favorite character  old obi wan  the way he would help luke connect stuff and find out his importance to the story without giving him all the sad things about his family 
  favorite moment  when luke looses his family and decides to go away to alderaan  it was an important kick starter when it comes to the rest of the story in her opinion  


episode 5  very nice episode  she loved seeing yoda and luke training and she liked how luke really went after that training  the way they separated the main characters was sad for her at the beginning but she found it good after all because of the training as well  she was surprised to see leia and han together  she thought she would end up with luke  with the kiss in hoth and all  she didn t know about the twins   she found the whole thing with vader very sad because she was expecting luke to be proud of his dad but in the end his dad is not a hero at all 
  favorite character  master yoda  after all she loves grogu very much
  favorite moment  luke actually having to insist about being trained by master yoda and sustaining that spark of hope about becoming a jedi  and also r2 being always at his side 


episode 6  she liked this one a lot  the plan that was in motion in tatooine was a very good team effort and leia was taking so many risks and showing a lot of strength  she found her to be very brave and not at all the princess in distresses and that she has the same adventures as the boys  she also thought lando to be that guy who brings hope to some very dire situations and it was good how he does that out of nowhere  and his friendship with han is awesome and very beautiful  she didn t really expect vader to die  she was sad to see him go  she didn t think that evil  rigid  figure would regret anything and she found it nice that it was luke with his love and his light side that brought him back  after all the episodes  she had the impression that in vader there was nothing left of anakin    until luke showed up    and with that there was hope  and with that luke finally could find the hero that was his dad 
  favorite character  in this episode it would be vader because she was very surprising to see him as a human being 
  favorite moment  luke forgiving vader and trying to save him


episode 1  she liked this one very much too and she loved to see anakin winning the pod race and also loved the moment in which he has to leave and say goodbye to his mom  only to hesitate and go back for a hug  when his mom wants him to go he promises he will come back and that was very emotional  looking back at how innocent he was  she was surprised to see that little boy was vader  she remembers how obi wan didn t want to take the boy and she wonders now if obi wan always felt like anakin would be difficult to train  she found obi wan to be a very loyal person to the jedi and to his master and to be one the greatest jedi masters  looking back it was very beautiful to see him honoring his master s wish and also being noble to teach anakin what the jedi are  as altruistic and good people and etc  she is looking forward to his series lmao  also  she really liked padme  with this episode she started seeing a trend in star wars that women are there to shoot  fight and take risks too  and anakin was very cute in that one  poor child 
  favorite character  shmi  it was very brave and very beautiful to see his mom supporting him to have a better life  knowing full well they would not see again 
  favorite moment  seeing obi wan and qui gon fighting together was great and in the end seeing obi wan fighting with his master s lightsaber and winning was a very beautiful moment  also  she was baffled with maul s double saber  and his general design  


episode 2  she found this episode to be very nice but she never imagined that so many jedi would die like 5they did in the arena  since she believed that they would be able to resist and face the droids  she found it sad to see so many die  she found it odd to see that jedi can be fragile too and die in the middle of the war and was suprised and sad to see how hard it was for them to fight and survive  in the begging she didn t find anakin and padme a good couple because he was too much of a rebel and she was very righteous and loyal to her duty  she could feel that they really loved each other but she was way ahead of him in terms of maturity and placing her duty over her emotions  while he was the opposite  bring so impulsive  she didn t think he would give in to the feelings  after everything she found it beautiful to seem them together but it was already obvious that this wouldn t end up well  lmao  about  those guys on a round stone table  she found them evil and manipulative  she found the separatists hard to argue with and that everything was really going towards conflict  she liked how yoda was fighting because it showed well his ability with the force and the lightsaber  not being fragile as he would look and being a very balanced guy 
  favorite character  jango fett  his attempt to teach and be there with boba was well shown  she didn t imagine that boba of all people would have that deep story and that his dad would be there by his side 
  favorite moment  when anakin looses his arm  not that the scene is beautiful at all  but it was a very strong moment  she didn t imagine that something like that would happen to anakin and it hit her like a jump scare lmao  


episode 3  that was the very sad episode of the bunch  she thought that if the jedi had trusted him more things would have been different  not trusting him maybe made his head spin so much that allowed palatine to manipulate him further  she thought that the fragility of the council and of the jedi were showed on this episode and the representation here was that the jedi are not perfect heroes but people with mistakes  anakin would need more trust not to dive into the dark side like he did and palatine really took the opportunity here to promise him what he would never have  and give him comfort that he couldn t find with the jedi   at least obi wan was there for him  padme s death was something that she didn t expect as well  she was very sad to see how anakin feet and the saddest thing was seeing obi wan suffering and crying when leaving vader to burn  also  she was really impressed to see four lightsabers at once with grievous and baffled to see anakin force choking padme 
  favorite character  bail organa  the way he was there to support the situation even though he had nothing to do with anything was noble  he gave himself to protect a child and this was really out of a good heart 
  favorite moment  the skywalker family end  specially when obi wan takes luke to owen and beru and when  during padme s funeral  we can see everyone so sad  this showed how much of a symbol she was  nothing would take away her image of righteous and what she meant to the people


episodes 7  8 and 9  which we watched in two days since she was hooked lol   very good trilogy  she found it very sad when han died and seeing chewy suffering was very hard  she wasn t expecting a character like rey  it was a nice surprise for her  also she would never expect luke as a recluse and bitter person  it broke her hearth and she found it very bad to see him with no will and no hope after all the fight that she saw during the ot  she also found it very dissapointing to see han and leia so apart because it was obvious that they loved each other very much  she liked how finn let go of his life and beliefs in order to live differently and better  it was very brave of him and it made for an awesome character  she never in a million years would expect rey to be palatine s granddaughter and it was beautiful to see her and leia hug  having leia basically adopting her in a way  seeing rey insist with luke was good for the story and also very fundamental for luke  to help him find meaning again  and this is pretty nice  also  adopting the skywalker name was a beautiful moment and a nice closing for the saga  she also liked her going  i m all the jedi   
  favorite characters  finn  luke  rey and rose  she found rose to be a very good surprise and significant to the idea of being loyal to a cause  
  favorite moments  rey skywalker  finn killing phasma and a very remarkable scene but not very happy  han being killed and having chewy so sad    


rouge one  she liked that one very much  it was very nice thar new characters are always showing up and that they are usually just regular people for the galaxy  jyn was a good example of that for her  she liked where jyn lived with her parents and having the family always at risk and trained to run was a very nice touch  it was awesome how this movie showed the other side of the empire  as in showing how galen wasn t a bad person but was still working for them  so far she had seen only people full of hate and evil in the empire   she liked saw guerreira too and how the movie showed the other side of the rebels  the extremists who make things more difficult than they help  also seeing vader was an awesome surprise 
  favorite character  galen  being so altruistic and brave 
  favorite moment  when galen admits his guilt to save his co workers as krenic asks who warned the cargo pilot  also  when he died and jyn hugs him one last time  knowing that galen did what he could to help and protect her  and not just letting her go with saw with no further development 


solo  very good and very fun movie  she liked seeing the young han doing the same stuff as old han  like being witty and all   also seeing him from another point of view  looking at all the way that lead him to be the scoundrel  it was nice to see him and qi ra together and it would have been nice to see their story together  their feelings for each other didn t go away and this was a nice thing to see  she made a sacrifice of letting him go just to see him succeed and put him out of the aim of crimson dawn  she wouldn t leave her position she was for him and she didn t want him to let go of who he is for her  it was also very nice to see han and chewbacca meet  she didn t expect to see chewy as a monster at all  also  knowing and seeing the falcon and it s story was awesome  she loved to see that on the movie and how he got it  
  favorite character  chewbacca  a highlight for her was seeing chewbacca dropping the job to help his people  she found it very good to see his aspiration and loyalty  it really showed him as more than just han s buddy  where is the chewbacca series 
  favorite moment  when he wins the falcon  the final game was fun 




also  i showed her some series  which would make for a whole other post but it is worth mentioning 



the book of boba fett  she loved the series  it was very nice to see mando and grogu there out of nowhere  it was very surprising to see the sand people like that  she found them to be monsters before this series  a highlight in the series was when boba got his gaffi stick 


the mandalorian  this is her favorite star wars content out of everything  her favorite thing is the story of mando and grogu  seeing luke as a jedi master there and in boba fett was awesome  and about that  in boba  she didn t expect at all that grogu would choose mando and was happy and surprised 


the bad batch  she loves omega  it was sad to see kamini go  for her it was another mando and baby with hunter and omega  she really liked to be shown another point of view when dealing with the clones  by showing them as human  people  who can give love too 


lego star wars terrifying tales  it was very fun  albeit a bit strange to see everyone so  squared   i might have to show her the other specials 


clone wars  2003   she doesn t remember this one much because she is confusing it with canon material lmao  she proposed watching again    which we will 



so that is it  i m happy to share stuff with her and also my mom and dad and thought you all would want to know about an outsiders opinion ",1646201129,starwars

how were the clone wars meant to begin ,"i m going to assert that the the events of aotc were pretty far outside of palpatine s plan  such as the fact that the jedi stumbled upon the gar as opposed to having sifo dyas  order being filled shortly after the military creation act is passed  which again  doesn t get passed as a result of padmé surviving the attempts on her life  additionally  obi wan stumbling upon the gar on kamino leads him to geonosis where he find dooku and the rest of the separatist council 

i think it s a safe bet that palpatine didn t want to risk having dooku  jango  grievous  in the catacombs  and the separatist council all being captured in the first battle of the war  ending it before it started   which begs the question  when or where do you think palpatine had chosen as the inciting incident or battle of the clone wars ",1646199021,starwars

satine was a terrible ruler,i know this sounds a bit harsh but let me get this clear  normally  her way of ruling is a good way to do so  but for mandalore  it is not  as an example  imagine a pope decided one day that they would change the religion to satanism  when satine changed mandalores ideals into pacifism  it completely stomped on everything madalore and what it was known for  even if it was bad  its still the countries culture  please tell me if i missed anything ,1646190846,starwars

who s the rightful ruler of mandalore ,it s said constantly whoever owns the darksaber is the rightful ruler of mandalore  and whoever kills the previous owner of the darksaber takes ownership of it  pre vizsla is the first person we see to own it  so we can assume he s the rightful ruler of mandalore  maul kills him and takes ownership  obi wan kills maul  vader kills obi wan  palpatine kills vader  but vader also kills palpatine  so who owns it now  if anyone  it could be said rey is the owner because she finally killed palpatine but i wouldn t count essentially palpatine s clone as the same palpatine killed by vader ,1646189755,starwars
what do you think ,"i feel like the obvious answer is no  but     



do you think someone like george lucas or dave filoni ever gets bored and browses these subs either to get a feel for the fans opinions or to just have conversations  also maybe to try to get a point across that wasn t received as they intended

what if luke and leia s roles were switched

what if ben never became kylo ren

what if alderaan wasn t destroyed

what if hosnian prime wasn t destroyed  because that ending for the new republic sucked 

what if the new republic didn t dissolve its military

what if the alliance made use of the remnants of jabbas criminal empire to establish the new republic  now that would be cool  or if they just used its resources 

what if the separatists got a hold of the clones first

what if the empire won the galactic civil war

what if yoda used the pillar to kill dooku  yes that is a reference to hishe 

what if the empire kept the clones

what if the cis still existed after the establishment of the empire  three way galactic civil war ftw    it could also be related to the above what if

even commandos are numbers and nothing more ,"was replaying the old star wars republic commandos game  and it occurred to me just how human and disposable the characters are at the same time  you d think that the characters having distinct personalities like 07s hardcore and killer  40s techy and average  62s explosive loving foolhardiness and of course the tactical leadership of 38  after all this time operating together with different voices even  they never considered themselves as anything beyond a number  

i was hacking a console and one guy yelled  38 behind you   and i just responded like it was my name  that sort of hit home that these guys despite how clunky and confusing numbers are as individuals can be  it works  they are accustomed to being a number  a cog  a faceless gun among a sea of flesh and bone 

when you get downed  their first response if in combat is not concern or worry 

 sir  protocol dictates i can t get you until all hostiles are clear

from my understanding darth sidious is stated to be the most powerful sith lord in history    why   canon legends ,"this is not hate to sidious however i always see people state he is the most powerful  fine i can believe that however is this based of his manipulation of the jedi and the galaxy and his success in ruling it for a couple decades  

is it based of his lightsaber skills  

is it based of his force feats  which it what i think of    in canon i agree he is the most powerful currently   but in legends i would argue some old republic sith lords were miles ahead

so  do people believe he is the most powerful sith lord  canon or legends and why

i loved the mandalorian 1  amp  2 and bobf but i noticed one thing and its this  they really need to do a better job of reintroducing  introducing former characters from the cartoons  for example when they bring in cad bane i honestly have no idea who this is same goes for ahsoka tano or bo katan  as some one who hasn t watched clone wars rebels or bad batch i have no context for these characters  personally i think disney really needs to do something like a mini series like a 5 mins just telling people who haven t seem those shows to recap the characters back story ",1646171370,starwars

celebration 2022 tickets,"mtfbwyall 

i m a crazy one that never even knew about celebration 2 3 year ago  and therefore didn t know to buy tickets  but   i may be crazy  i ve already booked a hotel and bought disney and universal tickets to enjoy disneyland with my wife and daughter the week before celebration   so  even if i can not find celebration tickets  i can still enjoy our vacation 

so  i have 3 thoughts questions pleas 

1 	if anyone has any knowledge of where i could by a single ticket for myself for 1 or all 4 days that will not cost  1 500   please i beg of you  let me know  i of course want to pay for the ticket s but i simply can not afford  1 500 on a small church pastor s salary  ha ha ha ha

 i ve submitted my generic jedi  and hopefully my old ben costume soon trying to find a wig  to the rebel legion in the hopes i might find some more online communities there  too  to ask around about ticket possibilities  i m really hoping celebration will be the first time i can show off all my hard work of my costume s 

2 	if anyone is going to celebration and offering any get togethers in the evenings or lunch times  i d love to say hello and attend celebration vicariously through you  by hearing all about it when you are not in the floor or attending sessions 
3 	any news if the celebration organizing team are planning on possibly releasing any tickets that were returned due to the date change  i d be honored to volunteer or help any tables or the committees  too   if there is a waiting list  or something like that 

thanks so much in advance everyone  blessings and peace be with you all ",1646170521,starwars

ever since i saw  the bad batch  and crosshair s new imperial armor i thought he would raise ranks and become the first death trooper  who knows  maybe we re going to see something like this in season 2   so i tried to imagine how the character would look in that iconic  dreadful black armor  also  i tried to visualize a new deluxe packaging inside cover for hasbro figures like this crosshair  death trooper commander   a mix between  star wars battlefront ii  menus aesthetic and visual guides layout  data files  a longer description for the character and lots of details about his gear equipment  it would definitely be cool to have something like this in hand  sporting the comic book based packaging already seen with darth maul  sith apprentice   jaxxon or luke skywalker  amp  ysalamiri  do you like it  would you buy this

would the squeals work as a tv show ,i think a lot of us can remember not liking the prequel trilogy  however  the clone wars  2008  helped redeem a lot of aspects that fell sort of flat  the characters were well written and the story arcs were phenomenal  i loved the clone wars  it was a part of my childhood and it stays dear to heart to this day  i feel like the squeal trilogy could have some parts of it  fixed   if dave filoni or someone else were to work on a show that could introduce aspects between tfa  tlj  and tros or after those movies  then maybe we would come to appreciate the squeal trilogy more  i m still not a fan of the sequels  but i still sort of like tfa because it introduced some neat ideas like the first order and starkiller base  could they have worked  i don t know it just feels like wasted potential  i know the sequel talk isn t as prominent now that the kenobi show is coming up  i just had this in my head since i started rewatching the clone wars ,1646106273,starwars

alternate universe where anakin leaves the jedi order with ashoka after her trial along with padme leaving the senate to bring peace and root out corruption in both the separatists and the republic ,padme using her contacts on both sides of the clone wars to handle political corruption while anakin and ashoka become grey jedi whom seek to bring balance to the force  they eventually prove the chancellor is the sith they re after and kill him  they then start their own jedi order of grey jedi and with it anakin fulfills the prophecy to bring true balance to the force  luke and leia are still born but raised by their parents and they go on to continue keeping the force balanced ,1646102136,starwars

question about anakin and vader,"spoiler alert anakin becomes vader if you didn t know

my question however is  are anakin and vader different like split personalities or did anakin evolve to vader  

my question comes from the comic were we see vader bleeding a green kyber crystal but the crystal brings forth the goodness in anakin or something like that  did the crystal cleanse vader for a second  or however much the vision lasted   or did it return command to anakin",1646074432,starwars

how many did you know ,"1  yoda was almost played by a monkey 
george lucas originally planned for yoda to be played by an adorable monkey wearing a mask and carrying a cane 

2   ewok  is never actually said in the original trilogy 
the name of the cuddliest species in the galaxy is never actually spoken by any character in the films  the species is only identified in the script and closing credits 

3  return of the jedi almost had a very different ending 
george lucas toyed with the idea that after luke removes a dying vader s helmet  he puts it on and proclaims   now i am vader  and turns to the dark side 

4  depending on the movie  yoda has a different number of toes 
in the phantom menace  yoda has three toes  but in the empire strikes back  return of the jedi and the sith  he has four 

5  star wars and 2001  a space odyssey had the same production crew 
george lucas admired stanley kubrick s work so much that he hired as many people who worked on 2001 as he could  the group was referred to as  the class of 2001  

6  e t  was in the phantom menace  kind of  
the alien race of e t  makes an appearance in episode 1  officially connecting the worlds of george lucas and stephen spielberg sci fi 

7  chewbacca s voice is a mix of other animals 
chewbacca s signature voice is a mix of bears  walruses  lions  badgers and   rather worryingly   a mixture of dying animal sounds 

8  lightsaber noises came from an old television 
the trademark lightsabre sounds were created by combining the hum of an old television s picture tube and the buzz of a film projector s motor 

9  harrison ford almost wasn t 
han solo  burt reynolds was a top contender to play han solo  along with al pacino  jack nicholson and christopher walken 

10  darth vader is banned from all official star wars parties 
david prowse  the actor who portrayed darth vader  in form  not voice   is banned from attending star wars conventions and parties because george lucas finds him annoying",1646061989,starwars

clone wars question  newbie  help  ,"so  this is my first time watching the star wars movies  and i have decided to go the chronological way  i have watched the phantom menace and attack of the clones  and i know that now the events of the clone wars take place   before episode iii   

my first question is   should i bother with clone wars now   or just watch the all the films first  

and my most important question   since i know the clone wars film is pretty bad   and it follows the events of the first four episodes of the 3d clone wars series   that i dont want to  bother watching   i have decided to learn of the clone wars events from the comics  i have found a lot of clone wars comics  and i think what im looking for is    this    https   leagueofcomicgeeks com comics series 107163 star wars the clone wars  https   leagueofcomicgeeks com comics series 107163 star wars the clone wars     am i correct  if not   which comics would you suggest for a newbie ",1646060723,starwars

have you listened to the star wars audio plays ,"i was searching for something to listen to on youtube and found the audio plays  at first i thought it was just going to be the audio from the movies with some descriptive narration  but then i noticed it was 5 hours long 

this is actually a really high quality project    i am blown away by how good it is  i don t know who wrote this  but this is spectacular  i m guessing a novelist or a very skilled playwright because the character building and character interaction is top notch  the first bit really spends time with luke on tatooine  interacting with the other teens  his uncle pressures him into working on the farm  for his own safety   some of the kids dislike him because he wants to leave and they think he thinks he s better than him  the only support he gets is from biggs  who isn t around any more because he s a pilot in the resistance  i m only an hour in and it s got it s talons into me  i can t turn it off 

i can t say enough about how well the characters are being shaped here  i already know future events in the story are going to have a huge impact because of this 

mark hamill is doing the voice of luke  which just makes it so easy to immerse you in what s going on  he s so good at anything he does and he really acts well with just his voice  you can picture the gestures he s doing because his voice is just so expressive 

i highly recommend you listen to these  sorry if you already know about these  but i got my post deleted at r movies for talking about this  they don t allow discussion of big franchises  and really want to recommend this for people who might be interested and don t know about it ",1646055229,starwars
does anyone else have to cope with this problem ,"i m part of a generation that was around during return of the jedi s cinematic release  i consumed pretty much everything there was with a star wars tag on it  the entire expanded universe book collection still on my shelves  and of course read and loved regularly  i played every game i came across  i don t really dislike anything sw  even liked the sequel trilogy for what it is  

and now comes the tricky part  stating opinions or facts in the sw forum will be punished with a hailstorm of downvotes and hate  no matter how right you are  even if it s just an opinion  

that makes me always think about the episode  majority rule  from the orville  the fanbase just blindly hacking on the downvote button while not even realising what they re doing to people  

i take part in so many subreddits and everybody is just nice  calm and friendly  and then there is the sw fandoms toxicity looming over everything  where it just nerve racking for me to post anything    ",1646054822,starwars

watched clone wars 2003 for the first time  actually really good,i ll be honest i kind of liked the art style better than 08 09 clone wars  i mean clone wars animation isn t bad and it definitely improves around season 3 or 4  but i think 2d animation is just better in general and honestly i felt it fits star wars more  in general i felt clone wars 2003 fits better with the movies  don t get me wrong i love filoni s clone wars series  it provided us with a lot and expanded upon the lore much more  however the first fee seasons of clone wars were alright  2d clone wars i felt anakin and obi wan fit more closely to their prequel counterparts and the clones were really cool in it  another thing is i think it kind of fits with the timeframe more  as attack of the clones and revenge of the sith are supposedly 3 years apart  however with everything rhat happened in 09 clone wars it seems longer than 3 years  seems like its been 5  by the time we see anakin in the 09 series its implied at least a year passed imo  he has different hair  and also armor  and no longer a padawan   it would ve been cool to see more of that art style from the 03 series in 09 clone wars  genndy tartakovsky should get a chance to work on something again for star wars for a new animated series  maybe a series that takes place before the clone wars movie and after attack of the clones  or maybe a series taking place from the perspective of a stormtroopers  either way i think he should be brought back as his series is really good  and also made me remember that i actually owned star wars figurines based off his 03 clone wars series ,1646031793,starwars
my opinion on vader and palpatine,ok  so i m not quite sure if anyone or everyone else has this same opinion  but  i personally believe that anakin himself is very strong yes  but his darker counter part  vader  isn t necessarily weaker by that much  i believe the only reason palpatine is considered stronger than vader is due to the mental grasp sheev had on ani vader  and take note of the fact that vader s suit made him pretty powerful  while inflicting pain  yes  but sheev also had the upper hand there  seeing as he forged the suit to be sensitive to force lightning  i feel that if vader wanted  he could have had a chance against palpatine if he modified his suit  and were as brave as we was during his time with the jedi  thank you ,1646031437,starwars

i remember reading somewhere that a jedi is only considered a master if their padawan successfully becomes a jedi knight  so  by that  the reason anakin wasn t a master was because ahsoka left  and would break obi wan s master title when anakin fell to the dark side

 spoilers  if the galactic starcruiser hotel and galaxy s edge are canon  how does that fit with the sequel trilogy ,in the disney canon  rey is spending time training with leia in between tlj and tros  isolated  although  in the theme parks  she s very active within the resistance and has encountered kylo ren twice in between the last two movies  if not more  in galaxy s edge  they are seen dueling in front of droid depot  in the starcruiser  rey is protecting a jedi holocron from kylo ren for some reason  it seems their ambiguous bond and lack of narrative are being opportunistically used by disney for their parks  if the parks were ot  disney could not do the same with luke and vader because the movies have a clear narrative and arc  i e  luke can t fight vader on batuu   is this disney milking the pair for easy lightsaber entertainment in their parks  is this how disney explains how the resistance s numbers grew from 500 to much more in between tlj and tros  is this a possible addition to the disney canon hinting at a future with rey leading a jedi order  why would disney use a hotel to debut a new film plot  what s going on with disney and star wars ,1646022856,starwars
gungi would be the deadliest jedi ever,in the young jedi arc in the clone wars  one of the younglings was a wookie named gungi  this guy would probably be a freaking beast in battle  wookie s are capable of tearing arms off with little to no issue when adults  not only that  but gungi is capable of using the force  so that would give him another huge advantage in battle  also  he has proficiency with a lightsaber  making him a good fighter  soif he was fully grown and was up against a big group of enemies all at once  he would probably defeat them all in a 4 or 5 minutes ,1646021770,starwars

without retconning the sequels  what would you change at lucas films for the inevitable next trilogy ,if it was me  i would hire george lucas as a co creative and co director role  he is obviously one of the greatest creative geniuses of our time  the concepts and designs that came out of the prequels are especially interesting  and the og trilogy too  but as the prequels proved  he clearly struggles with writing believable dialogue and story beats  so i think if you paired him up with a good director and writer  they could help him iron out and trim back his more   shall we say  interesting  ideas  but that s just me  curious to see what your ideas are ,1646021027,starwars

cool but   ,"mando and the different prequel things are great but its kind of pointless knowing it all just builds up to ros  at the same time  the amount of inconsistencies  plot holes  and ret cons make me wish the whole thing could be redone  rebooting would be terrible though  

so maybe toss everything forward in time beyond the sequel trilogy  start fresh with the scenes on degaoba being the main influence and vibe  characters learning to look past the fast paced  futuristic  high tech world they live in to find balance with theirselves and nature  no sith and jedi stuff  just use of the force on a primal level while trying not to be overcome by it  

maybe im overthinking things but thats the movie i want to see ",1646015941,starwars
death watch   clone wars v  the mandalorian,"not sure if there s an actual question here  or if i m just putting it out there for general discussion 

when the mandalorian first aired  i hadn t seen any of the clone wars  rebels  or the bad batch  so the show was my first introduction to mandalorians  death watch  etc   more recently i ve watched all of clone wars  and i was struck by how different the portrayal of death watch is  they re straight up bad guys   they hate the jedi  and they joined with maul to violently overthrow the peaceful mandalorian government    i m find it hard to reconcile this with din djarin  who is a good  moral person   he claims to have been raised by the death watch  but doesn t really behave like them at all other than in mostly symbolic ways such as never taking is helmet off

what to do with my life,"so i always had a mild interest in star wars but never fully got into it  even though my brother was a huge fan  a few weeks ago i got high and decided i was gonna watch all  well most  of the movies  disney series  in chronological order to see he loved them so much 

so i began with phantom menace  and every night for the last few weeks i came home from work got high and continued my star wars journey  i took a long gap between aotc and rots to watch through all of the clone wars series  and holy shit this was my favorite of the lot  its probably been said loads before but it adds so much more depth to the characters  the world and the clone wars in total  truly top tier star wars content  i found myself getting completely invested in characters i barely knew much about before  i found asajj ventress  arc to be one of the best and found myself rooting for her towards the end  ashokas development in the later seasons is great and i love how we got to see more of jedi that don t get much airtime in the movies  characters like mace windu and plo koon  also maul with the darksaber vs sidious  inject that shit into my veins  this show had some of the best moments in the series  i watched a supercut of last episodes of season 7 along with rots switching back and forth between the two for the full experience  and holy shit it gave me chills  

after this i watched through rebels  i hadnt really got much interest in the spin off movies  and just when i thought nothing could compare this to cw  rebels goes and does just that  although i wasn t a huge fan of the change in art style  this series gave some of the best moments in the franchise  ashokas face off with vader being one of them 

the sequels were great too  even though i have to say i definitely prefferred the prequels  after these i jumped straight into the mandalorian  this was way better than i expected it to be  it was amazing to see all these characters that id come to know love be brought into live action  people like ashoka and bo katan  and of course we have to talk about the star of the show  grogu  he is the cutest thing in the world and no one can tell me otherwise  this is the way  

next up was book of boba fett  and when i heard that this would continue the madolorians storyline i got super hyped  and honeslty after clone wars i have to say this was a close  second  i thought it started a little slow but the later episodes really made up for that  getting to see  gt  ashoka meet luke  lt  was so cool but my favorite moment of the show by far was when  gt  cad bane showed up  lt    i marked out i m ngl 

thing is now i m finished watching everything i was really interested in watching  now i don t know what to do  i came home from work tonight and had a giant star wars size hole in my evening  i know its awhile before we get kenobi and ashokas series  so what do you think i should watch in the mean time  are the side films worth watching  and what about the new trilogy  is it really as bad as everyone says it is  i don t know any of the characters or have any idea of what they re about so should i just bite the bullet and watch them  are they any good youtube channels covering comic arcs i should check out  what do you guys think ",1646011247,starwars

seeing the despecialized version of star wars on the big screen ,"growing up i have always been a fan of star wars  especially a new hope  star wars has always been one of the earliest movie memories i have and it started with the cbs fox video tape  even when the special editions of the original movies came out i still watched the old vhs tape that we still had  i have never seen the special editions in theaters   i was seven and had no opportunity to see them since we lived out of country   

for a long time i have always wanted to see a new hope in theaters  even if it was the special edition  when i heard that my local theater was having a screening of this film  i immediately bought a ticket  since i am good friends with the people that work there  one of them told me secretly that it was the despecialized version which got me even more hyped up  

now coming out of the theater i felt really happy but in a way that it almost brought me to tears  it was as if i found a missing piece of my childhood and i now feel complete  i am just getting emotional just writing this   i have never felt this way after watching a movie  this movie made me feel like a kid again and now i understand why it had made such an impact on audiences way back in 1977  i am so glad to be a star wars fan

grogu and mando reuniting so soon has disney s corporate meddling written all over it," it just felt like they weren t confident in din s character to keep him away from grogu  in fact a lack of confidence is what made this entire show very dull imo since they  ditched boba and gave din the spotlight for 2 whole episodes  also the emotional ending  of mandalorian season 2 was ruined for me 

 they rushed their reunion so quickly for no other reason then to sell more merchandise it feels  not only that  but really everything that happened with din felt rushed to me  him being kicked out of the mandalorian religion  building a new ship  dealing with not having a purpose and falling back into his old occupation  all of these interesting concepts were rushed into the span of one episode  where i feel if they had spaced them out over the course of a season  they would have worked much better 

 i was hoping that we would see basically a two sided stir for mando season 3  we would get the story that i m assuming is what we are still getting with mando seeking out bo katan and working to reclaim mandalore while on the other side of the coin we would see grogu training with luke and all the while we get to see the two of them struggling in different ways about missing one another",1646000601,starwars

kylo stance saber and harry potter,"after learning more about the dark saber  you need to kill or beat its owner to gain its control  if you don t  it won t  listen  to you and becomes very heavy unwieldy 

this unwieldy dark saber stance condition reminds me of the stance of kylo ren  he often points it to the ground  also  when he swings his saber it  seems  to cost him more effort than other saber wielders 

this is combination with the appearance of kylo s saber  not smooth because of the broken crystal   gave me some interesting thoughts

the tuskens in book of boba fett,"i have mixed feelings on how  book of boba  incorporated the tuskens   spoilers below  

a lot of it was amazing  it was really important for them not to just be mindlessly violent  sand people   i e   fictional stand ins for real life indigenous or colonized people   book  did a great job of fleshing out their personhood and their culture in a way that built on rather than undermined the way they were portrayed in the ot  for instance  the fact that it was a chance for temuera morrison and the creators to introduce variations on maori culture in real life was excellent  too often star wars echoes real life racism and colonialism  and this was a great corrective to that 

and then   it went nowhere  the tuskens who saved boba and changed him as a person are massacred  and then we don t see any other tuskens for the rest of the series  the massacred is referenced  but only as a plot point and a pain point for boba  you realize that all the work those first couple episodes did isn t really about the tuskens at all  but just a plot device and a way to develop boba s character  it s completely instrumental  and for me that undercuts a lot of what was good about those episodes  it makes me feel like the creators of the show  here i m excluding morrison  only cared about the tuskens insofar as it served boba s development  and otherwise were happy to toss them in the scrap heap  it didn t have to be either or  they could continue to matter to boba even as they continued to have a role in the plot and in life on tattooine  on their own terms  a lot of us predicted that might happen  but that s not the direction they went

in the episode  if i remember correctly   dod refers to nute gunray as an extremist and that they don t support him 

so let me see if i got this right 

dod claims that gunray and his forces are a splinter group broken off from the actual trade federation to join the cis  that he basically has stolen a ton of their droids and ships  that the tf used as security forces  and repainted them for his own use  that s why the cis vulture droids and mtts are blue instead of brown like the tf vultures and mtts from tpm  that s he s falsely claiming to be a part of the tf when he really isn t anymore 

as long as no one catches dod openly supporting the cis  they can t criminalize the tf and jail him

fixing the biker gang from the book of boba fett,"the book of boba fett has proven to be a divisive series for star wars fans  one aspect in particular being the biker gang that fett hires as his henchmen 

introduced in episode 3  this gang of misfit youths appeared drastically out of place on the desert planet of tatooine  with their cybernetic body parts  slick  punky outfits  and  most controversial of all  shiny colorful speeders that traveled at the rapid pace of one mile per hour  

however  i was willing to give all of that a pass so long as these characters were properly fleshed out and entertaining   in other words  if they were actually written well and served a significant purpose to the plot 

with the series now concluded  i can say with the utmost confidence that this was not the case  with these characters being severely underdeveloped and outright boring   a humongous injustice on the part of the showrunners  who were instead more concerned with flashbacks to fett s past as well as kicking off the mandalorian season 3 

so how do we fix them  it s simple  flesh out their aesthetics 

you see  while the gang sticks out like a sore thumb on tatooine  they would fit perfectly on the city world of coruscant  so make that their home world and explain   or better yet  show   how they came to be a gang and how they ended up on the desert planet  that gives them a backstory  laying the foundation for their character arcs 

 do not leave it to be explained on some spinoff eu novel or wookiepedia entry because that is not how you write characters you want your audience to like  

now that your characters have a backstory to be explored  you can develop their arc  

when boba fett first meets the gang  have him or even fennec shand  though preferably fett himself  take note of their squeaky clean  youthful appearance and come to the conclusion that 

1  they are foreigners to the planet
2  they lack experience
3  they won t survive unless they receive the correct discipline 

this leads to a mentor student between fett shand and the gang where they frequently put them to the test and note their level of skill and where they need improvement 

episode 3 itself presented 2 opportunities for this 

1  black krrsantan invading boba s palace and attacking him  instead of having the gang successfully stop the wookie and all s well that ends well  have fett chastise his entire staff for letting their guard down  which enabled krrsantan to sneak in undetected  
2  the speeder chase  easily the single most controversial and panned moment from the show  this could have actually been used to the plot s advantage and opened up and opportunity for development of the gang and fett s relationship with them  have him send them out to chase down the majordomo  but he gives them a time limit  have the gang cause total havoc in the streets as they did  looking like complete buffoons and just when the majordomo seems to have escaped them  have fett land on the hood of his speeder using his jetpack  grab him by his collar out of his seat  and take off into the air once more  sending the speeder crashing into a nearby building   fett then pins the blame of that collateral damage entirely on the gang for failing to capture the majordomo in time 

what this can then lead to is tension between fett and his new henchmen where he questions whether hiring a group of youthful misfits was a good idea  before they promise to step up their game in future resulting in fett giving them one more chance to prove their worth  and slowly  as the series goes on  they do just that  regaining fett s trust and earning his respect 

additionally  this can lead to a scene where fett speaks to one of them   probably the british leader girl   who opens up to him about their past  which is where their backstory can be explained or better yet  shown through flashbacks with narration  this moment of bonding can further be used to highlight fett s own development   that while he is still a ruthless crimelord  he is willing to hear out his workers instead of just barking orders 

so yes  this isn t much and doesn t fix some of the other major issues with the book of boba fett but it is my attempt at improving one area  let me know your thoughts in the comments ",1645974362,starwars

  poe is an imperial ace  the opening village are ir civvies slauightered by vengeful nr troops 
  finn is then a nr deserter 
  rey s storyline basically untouched 
  ben still talks to vaders helmet  i am what you should have been   force ghost anakin arguing with ben  refusing to teach him how to become a force ghost  as this is a power only to be used by the light side 
  starkiller base is a new republic weapon of mass destruction  used to destroy ir hold outs and civilian worlds 
  end of the film plays out similarly  but with han solo leading an ir force to destroy the base   leia doesnt even realise she has slipped to the dark side  she never had the training luke did  
  han then allows the others to retreat while he tries to hold off ben  ben kills han out of anger that he would side with the imperials

if there s one thing i always respected in starwars,"i m not a big fan or anything  but if there s one thing i always thought was well done  fun for the spectator  made sense  and was also probably entirely unintentional  is  

 amp  x200b 

   how much   fun   palpatine is having  he s being campy as fuck  laughing maniacally  joking  snearing  smiling  taunting      one could say he s probably the only chararacter in the saga having a good time at all in the movies  

 amp  x200b 

look at him fight yoda  he s unwinding  letting loose  cackling like a lunatic  and all the fun he s having    its contagious to the viewer  and that is the unintentional power of camp  it works  we cheer for him because he s having a good time

prior to this  i had only seen the original 3 films from the 70 s and 80 s  my younger self thought they were  okay   but ultimately shrugged it off 

several months ago i decided to give the original three another try  and i was hooked   line and sinker  presently  the only content i have left to watch is the 2 or so animated series   which i ll admit i may skip as i generally dislike animated movies series altogether 

during my recent fandom  i ve obviously been googling shit to help me understand certain topics in the movies series  and i ve come across wookipedia  i ve gone down the rabbit hole on that site quit a bit  and have read some really interesting stuff about star wars history prior to phantom menace

i honestly thought she was fine in mando and bobf  her acting didn t blow me away or anything like that but i liked seeing the character in live action and i do think she did a fine job with a very limited screen time and mediocre dialogue writting 

so why all the hate for her portrayal  is it because fans don t think she s a good actress  they don t like the character in general and are sick of her  or is it simply the case of her not being the right fit for ahsoka which is sorta weird since she was fancasted iirc   maybe all of the above ",1645926012,starwars

disney  original trilogy rant,"let me just say  i absolutely despise how they altered the original trilogy by putting in  the super star destroyers   

it looks completely fake  way  way  way more fake than the normal star destroyers  

it completely ruins the feeling of nostalgia  when i see the super star destroyer i remember how disney obliterated an amazing franchise and it just makes me depressed 

i remember when i was a kid  watching the original trilogy there was no super star destroyer  if you think there always has been the super star destroyer in the original trilogy you could not be more wrong  it has only been roughly since disney bought star wars that they altered the original trilogy this much and this unjustly ",1645923778,starwars

i would just like to start by saying that this is just my opinion and if you disagree with anything said  that is 100  okay  however  if you are going to disagree please be respectful and constructive  i just finished re watching the prequels after not seeing them for a long time and the whole time i was watching them all i could think was how great they really are  i absolutely love all three of them with all the story and character development that it presents  i love all the compelling characters  with maybe the exception of jar jar  i think we can all agree that he is still pretty bad lol  from anakin  amp  padme  qui gon  amp  obi wan  the clones  amp  jango  and many more  there are so many fantastic moments  excellent visuals  and music it s not hard to see that these films are truly great  another reason i have grown to appreciate them  even more  is because of disney s sequels  i do not like those movies  and seeing how bad they are caused me to put the sequels in an even greater light  the prequels are also where we are introduced to one of the best tragic stories of all time  anakin  every time i re watch anakin s story arc i can t help but feel sad for all the things he went through  all he wanted was to be with padme  have a family  and bring peace  that is one of the biggest reasons why the prequels are great  they present a story that really makes you feel something  the final reason as to why i love them is because these films  specifically aotc  led to the show that made my childhood  the clone wars  i just wanted to express my love and appreciation for these 3 movies and really the franchise as a whole  again  this is all my opinion  and feel free to say why you did didn t like the prequels ",1645897671,starwars

star trek has actually become less woke ,"this might be a bit of a controversial opinion  but i do believe that  nu trek   meaning the abrams movies  discovery  picard and lower decks   my opinion about their general quality completely aside  are actually less woke than  old trek   everything up to including  enterprise    

first things first  i will use woke as a neutrally connotated term 

yes  excessive marketing and wrong facts  burnham is allegedly the first black female captain even though there were tons of them before etc   may try to lead us to believe that this new star trek is woke and inclusive and what not  they make such a deal about how diverse and inclusive this new show is  in a way that s never been done before  however  this is merely a facade  a marketing ploy  old trek was more woke than new trek ever could be  old trek  while admittedly occasionally offensive  had people of all genders  sexualities  skin colors etc   even in high powerful positions  and it did all of this pretending it was the most normal thing in the world  and all of this at a time  where no other media did this sort of thing  star trek was always controversial for crossing these  borders    for going  where no man had gone before 

new trek on the other hand tries to pretend this all never happened  and star trek was some mysogenistic  backwater series before the almighty savior cbs and paramount  it pretends to make achievements in inclusiveness and wokeness that are not achievements  because they have been done before  new trek was not the first to do anything concerning inclusiveness  it says it is  but it is not  it didn t dare cross any taboos of our time  but rather breaks old taboos that have long been broken and tries to make us feel like it s revolutionary   

name me one minority group that was not represented in old trek and that is in nu trek  i dare you  i can t think of any 

name one half as controversial topic tackled in nu trek that resulted in public outrage  i dare you  

so  in trying so hard to be woke and making such a big deal about their diverseness  they have actually made star trek less woke  rather than more  which i consider a bad thing  a really bad thing

  deleted scenes 

first deleted scene is soji stalking down the halls of the artifact  and ramdha sees her  recognising her as seb cheneb 

second is a i  soong and sutra discussing not being able to create enough flowers to contend with the incoming romulans  and building beaconl  soong acknowledges the necessity  and says  with trepidation  that he s alright with dying  then he seems to alight on the idea that would save him  presumably this would then lead into his creating the golem that he was going to transfer himself into  i do like the scene because it implies it wasn t always soong s goal to create a synthetic body for himself     which makes sense consider how readily he gives it up for picard    but i dislike it because he doesn t really even balk at galaxy wide genocide  his going along with sutra s seems less horrible if he s not aware of the full scope of what will happen if they summon the extra galactic synthetics 

   episode 

i love the coppelius defense system being giant  spaceborn flowers  it s such a tos concept  and the execution is wonderful  especially after dhaj and soji s occasional reference to their fictional father being a botanist 

seeing the crew come together  working together is nice  conflict might drive stories forward  but there is definitely something to be said about heartwarming it is to see people cooperating and displaying empathy 

similar to the orchids  the coppelian synths  with their togas and abnormal skin tones  are prefect  their encountering picard seems almost out of  logan s run  when the citizens of the city of domes meet the old man 

isa briones should turn as sutra is so subtly different form soji or dhaj  it s really great seeing the two characters on screen  interacting with one another 

a lot of people overreacted to the ocarina looking synth tool  but that s silly  the device seems to be an advanced replicator with a neural interface  this is just an extrapolation of extant star trek technology  and the fact that saga didn t have the context to explain it to raffi in a way she would understand makes sense given their vastly different life experiences  much like operating the tool  there are a lot of trekkies out there who would benefit from using their imagination  even a little bit 

saga asking narek for pointers on how romulans treat their prisoners is a pretty good bit 

again  the forum at the end of the episode reminds me of tos  kirk making an impassioned speech about how the people on the planet of the week need to rise above whatever it is that s holding them back  unfortunately in this case there is a more familiar orator whom the naive synths put their faith in 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  probably the discussion following picard s reveal to the crew about his terminal brain abnormality  that s some good star trek stuff   
   low point  bruce maddox having a photo of himself and jurati making out on a loop in his office  that s weird  also  more seriously  soong s sinister vibe doesn t mesh with his characterization next episode where he turns on sutra   
   verdict  i didn t have a lot ot say about this episode  because ultimately it s mostly fine  i don t think it s as good as  broken pieces  or  nepenthe   but it s not bad  i remember when i first watched it feeling as though it was a strong foundation for the second instalment  and being pretty hopeful about what would come 

___

1x01      et in arcadia ego  part 2   

   deleted scene 

in the aftermath of the episode  there s a montage of soong  jurati  soji  and picard all looking pensive  ramdha is showing a pair of the synths the romulan tarot cards  aboard the la sirena  jurati and rios kiss 

   episode 

narek is a lot more tolerable interacting with the la sirena crew than at an other point in the series  and i sincerely enjoy more worldbuilding with his recitation of the gamadan myth 

this is hardly a new observation  but the romulan fleet and their federation counterparts are composed of entirely too many ships  the number tips things towards ludicrousness 

so  i want to talk about mass effect for a moment  it is  simply put  my favourite video game  and a lot of people upon watching this episode decided that the plot was lifted whole from that game  synthetic life summoning other synthetics from beyond the galaxy  pretty similar  of course  however  the story in mass effect is not particularly new  and assuming that it was the source for this season of pic shows an astounding lack of pop culture literacy for science fiction fans  mass effect was inspired by lovecraftian cosmic horror  and i would imagine that  picard  was as well  ancient unknowable beings that drive people to madness  the zhat vash cult  narek s story of gamadan  the immense tentacles reaching through a tear in space  the difference  of course  between cosmic horror and trek is that trek s foundation is that a better world is possible through hope  and picard sacrifices himself to demonstrate that hope to soji 

unfortunately picard s sacrifice and good bye scene is followed up by completely undermining it  having him transferred to the synthetic body  i have no problem with the idea of jean luc picard as an android  but the narrative decision to immediately reverse his sacrifice is a complete misfire  only exacerbated by the fact that it s one scene right after the other  the show is attempting to have it both ways by maintaining it s big star that will draw in all the trekkies who want to watch their space dad  but also have this big moving moment where he dies surrounded by the crew who ve come together during the course of this adventure 

even worse  the revelation that data s mind has existed in this quantum simulation for 20 years  only to kill him off is masturbatory  i think most trekkies would agree that data s death in  nemesis  was anticlimactic  but trying to  fix  that and give him a proper send off here requires him to have existed  alone  with no one aware of his continuation for two decades  and that seems torturous   nemesis  left the door open for data s return  but the show choose to disregard that by emphasizing that b4 simply wasn t capable of assimilating data s mind  and then had this protracted attempting at tugging on our heartstrings 

that said  even though i disagree it s happening  i can admit the scene between data and picard is well done  it is a pleasure to see these two characters again having a conversation  even as i m annoyed that it is happening 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  picard s speech to soji on the open channel   
   low point  the death scene was overwrought considering it amounts to nothing   
   verdict  a very frustrating episode  i think i may have enjoyed it more on the rewatch  but still full of problems ",1646301665,startrek
a little observation about star trek as it is now    ,"firstly  i want to qualify this post by saying i love discovery  have since the first episode  the character growth for the crew has been immense and we ve followed them through incredible adventures and great adversity 

but   

am i the only one that thinks its beginning to get a bit  too  touchy feely 

don t get me wrong  the emotional impact on some of the characters has been wrenching and the actors have been brilliant at conveying it but  as a die hard star trek fan  i m beginning to get a bit antsy and just want them to have a mission that  doesn t  involve an anomaly or where the answer doesn t lead to profound self discovery  pun intended  

my wish for season 5 is that the federation  as it is  comes up against a force so mind boggingly malevolent and technologically advanced that they get their asses handed to them in the first few episodes and it takes the rest of the season just to draw level  let s see some action  let s see some dogfighting between fighter craft  let s see some honest to goodness space battles 

keep the emotion  keep the character growth but ditch some of the drama and ramp up the action 

or am i the only one ",1646301239,startrek

kind of looking for a show with a lot of seasons that i could get involved in  i just finished enterprise and i really enjoyed it  but it ended way too soon  

personally  i really enjoyed every series from tos through enterprise  but my favorites would probably be ds9 and tng    


i guess i could rewatch them  but sort of looking for something new as well if there is anything

star trek picard  the dark veil review,"last week i jumped into a book store and grabbed the first 4 star trek novels that i could find that i hadn t read 

to be honest  i didn t realize that it was   star trek picard   when i grabbed the book and if i had noticed i probably wouldn t have purchased this book    thank goodness i didn t realize it   

  my take on this book 

it feels like what you d expect to get out of star trek post tng  if you ve read any of the star trek titan novels and enjoyed them  this one will be right up your alley  i loved the new featured characters  i loved the new race that was introduced  i loved the motivations that all parties involved had throughout the entirety of this story and i felt that the ending was a believable conclusion  i d give it an 8 10  but i wouldn t recommend it to anyone who wasn t already fairly familiar with the star trek franchise ",1646265894,startrek

just reached  restrospect  in my voyager watch through and it s really troubling me,"although my personal absolute favourite star trek series is tng  i ve got a lot of love for voyager  what s troubling me about this episode apart from the obvious  you re reporting being violated but  since you can t 100  prove it  we re going to assume you re experiencing fake memories     also it s your fault that man died  feel bad  theme  is contrasting it with tng  

if you look at the remember me episode of tng one of the things that strikes you is the level of trust and respect shown to beverly crusher  without any concrete proof of what she was saying  the senior staff took her seriously  listened to her and started investigating on her word alone  obviously you could argue that s for reasons revealed at the end of the episode  but it didn t seem at all out of character  

one of the reasons i love voyager so much was that when it first came out it was so important to young me that there was a female captain  so to see a  potential  female assault victim being treated so poorly really upset me  i dont think it meant that much to younger  me when i saw it  but it s really tainted my enjoyment of voyager  

is it one of those product of their time things  was tng ever like this and my love for picard has just blinded me  or did the voyager show runners mess this one up ",1646254774,startrek
vance is the best admiral character in all of trek,"for most of trek history  starfleet admirals have usually been antagonists  and often cartoonish ones at that  ds9 bucked that trend a bit but i think discovery has knocked it way out of the park with admiral vance 

vance does one thing in particular that really elevates him above the rest for me  he protects his team s interests while advancing the goals of the organization as a whole  he has one foot in the political arena and one foot in the starfleet arena  and he finds compromises between the two  or sometimes loopholes  that give the starfleet side room to maneuver  if i were under his command  i d trust that he had my back  and i can t think of any previous trek admiral that gave me that impression 

oded fehr s restrained performance is just right for the character  he can crank up the intensity when it s called for  but usually  his demeanor gives off strong  this is the adult in the room  vibes 

i hope he sticks around for the long haul  it s a pleasure every time he appears on the show ",1646254740,startrek

however  with the tragic loss of beloved actor anton yelchin  the absence of his character of chekov will certainly have to be addressed   i m interested in the thoughts all of you might have on his the filmmakers will handle it 

i had a thought   i wondered if  in the tradition of giving tos actors  one more ride  as their character if the kelvin chekov might have been involved in a time travel incident wherein he became trapped within the time warp and aged to the point where it would be appropriate for walter koenig to portray him in the next installment 

without something like that happening we would have to face the idea that chekov was killed offscreen and that the remaining crew would observe some kind of memorial for him at the beginning of the new film

1x07      nepenthe   

   episode 

i know i m not alone in saying this was my favourite episode of the season  as an extremely awkward child  i gravitated towards data  now as an adult riker is the character whom i identify with probably more than any other of the tng crew  so seeing him return here was a big moment for me 

it was  and remains  absolutely buck wild that when oh gives jurati the tracking isotope and doesn t have to tell her it needs to be taken orally   it must be chewed   what  no  even though oh knows that jurati needs to ingest the isotope  she should still be aghast that agnes  first impulse was to put it in her mouth  this season is actually really good  as it demonstrates a wonderful contrast between the naive and friendly juarti  and the cold  sinister commodore oh  but the fact that agnes immediately goes to swallow this random thing she s handed is all i can think about 

the casualness with which the romulans execute the ex borg would be interesting if the series choose to give it greater focus  we ve had hugh mention a couple times how hated and maligned they are in the galaxy  and narissa treats them as though they re disposable  trash she can simply throw away  again  seems like a missed opportunity to actually deep dive into the ex borg s place on the galactic political stage  but the show chooses to treat them as fodder 

kestra is great  that s all 

while i was excited about seeing riker again  the reunion with troi is much more affecting  marina sirtis is able to put such genuine emotion into her performance that it s impossible for me to watch the pair hug and not mist up a bit 

the silliness of the story troi tells soji regarding thad s death is a huge stumbling block  accepting that the federation would condemn someone to death rather than provide the means of creating a cure is simply a bridge to far  a lot of people have criticized the federation presented in this series as being dystopic  and i personally think that s a hyperbolic assessment derived from a very narrow understanding of events  this is the one real piece of evidence where i would say that yes  the federation has backslid  worse though is trying to tie thad s death into the synth ban at all  it is such a ridiculous contrivance that it never should have made it past a first draft  let alone gotten shot  edited  and broadcast 

i m annoyed that the showrunners made me actually care about hugh only to kill him off  but at least it s not just to motivate elnor  who is significantly less of a character 

jurati s breakdown while they re attempting to evade narek seems to come too early in the story  rios and raffi clue into the fact that there s something up with her  and then in the next the next scene with them  it stars seems like raffi is attempting to find out what specifically the deal is  but it turns out she s actually just being kind  and i like it when characters are kind to one another  but it s out of line with the character they ve created for raffi  not because i think she doesn t have the capacity for kindness  but because her default state is paranoia  conspiracy  seeing connections  she was even looking at some of the romulan ex borg s art that hinted at her conclave of eight when agnes had her breakdown  but didn t even have an inkling that the two might be related  i have to assume that this is the result of a change in the script that did not retroactively connect back to the earlier motivations  even though it should have 

i want a comic book series about this rupert crandall dude kestra keeps bringing up  this guy sounds like he rules 

elnor finding seven s fenris ranger tag in hugh s office is another huge contrivance  i remember the first time i watched the episode i was confused because i assumed that it must be the one she gave picard  so how did it end up here  while it might make sense that hugh would have the tag  it s a storytelling misstep  because picard never uses his  and it s just too convenient that hugh not only has one  but elnor is able to find it  better if picard choose to give it to hugh while he was on the cube  or if picard had refused to take it  so seven handed it to elnor behind picard s back 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  there a lot to love about this episode  but i think marina sirtis  performance is spectacular   
   low point  troi s explanation for thad s death   
   verdict  probably the second best episode of the season  i know i can come across as somewhat negative  but a lot of the time when i pause the episode to make a note  it s often because something clanged for me  so yeah  despite the majority of my critique here being disparaging of what they ve done  that s largely because when episode is good  i m happily following along

1x08      broken pices   

   deleted scenes 

there are three deleted scenes for this episode  the first is the trill scientists soji met in episode two clambering down a corridor aboard the artifact before encountering an ex borg who announces   we are the borg   at which point she scrambles away  no doubt the scene was cut for time  but i think it would have worked in the episode  would have been nice to see the character again  establishing a continuity 

second is some unfinished cgi of borg nano machines repairing the cube  there s already at least one scene of that  so cutting the second makes sense 

the third scene is ramdha waking up in the medical facilities  i m not sure it adds anything unless there s another deleted scene following up on ramdha in a later episode 

 amp nbsp   
   episode 

i like the flashback to the admonition  there s a stark brutality to it that helps to but into context the zhat vash s motives  and the scene is shot and edited in a very affecting manner 

rios having a connection to soji is another contrivance  though i think by itself it would be fairly forgivable  and it does serve the overall story  unfortunately it stands out  especially in the binge watch  due to just how many contrivances the series expects the viewer to accept 

picard talking about data with soji is pretty good  i especially like picard observing that he and data were similar in their limited capacity to express emotion  and how obviously impactful it is when soji declares that data loved him 

not enough good can be said about santiago cabrera s heavy lift as all the emergency holograms  the different personalities and mannerisms he gives each goes beyond just the accents  enoch the nav hologram is too chipper  the hospitality holo    which closed captioning refers to as  mister hospitality  and that s a good bit    keeps on getting in people s personal space  great stuff 

the intercutting between jurati and soji  and rios and raffi is nicely done  they re very different conversations  but both are about the characters  intrinsic humanity 

it s a bit curious that the ibn majad would be stricken from starfleet s records entirely  rios covered up what happened  so why would the entire ship be redacted  i suppose oh might have been overzealous in the follow through 

this impromptu crew briefing with the mess of the la sirena standing in for the enterprise s briefing room makes me nostalgic for tng 

picard and rios connecting at the end of the episode also works well  and it s corny  but i enjoy picard s assertation that all they need to overcome is optimism and curiosity

who is the best main character from any series ,"as a mirror to another recent post  who is the best main character  not necessarily your favorite  but from a more objective writing acting production standpoint 


my vote would go to data 

 non humans usually provide the best foils for the federation characters  but data s pinnochio syndrome leads him to constantly exploring and seeking to understand the human condition  sometimes he s used just as a way to get picard to deliver a philosophical speech  and sometimes he s just big robot man doing robot man things  however  data also has fascinating backstory episodes  develops a lot as a character over the course of tng and the movies  and has very wholesome friendships with several other characters  further  data himself is the subject of several heavy hitting philosophical episodes that ask very hard questions about life and sentience

my thoughts on the original movies,"i ve been a star trek fan for a while but i m only now getting to the movies and i just finished undiscovered country 

its worth mentioning that i liked all of them  because i like star trek in general  but some were definitely better than others 

the motion picture  it definitely earned its reputation for being slow but i still thought it was a vibe and i liked the set pieces  the twist at the end was cool too 

wrath of khan  it deserves the hype and ricardo montalban is a fantastic villain  not much i can add to this one that hasn t already been said a hundred times 

search for spock  i thought christopher lloyd made a great klingon and it was well connected to the previous movie  otherwise  that s about all i remember 

the voyage home  this was my favorite one  it s totally absurd but that s exactly how i like my sci fi  chekov asking the sfpd officer where the nuclear vessels are with a heavy russian accent is one of my favorite moments in the whole franchise

the final frontier  i understand why this one is considered the worst but i didn t hate it  spocks half brother trying to contact god was a cool concept but the execution was off 

the undiscovered country  when star trek does political intrigue it  usually  does it very well  and this was no exception  chang was awesome and seeing the khitomer accords was cool after hearing about it so much in tng and ds9  a great final entry  makes me wish we got that captain sulu series ",1646194646,startrek

 chapter one  https   redd it t3cfy1 

___

1x04      absolute candor   

   the episode 

i don t think i noticed this kind of twangy  space western music that the episode opens with during my first watch  it s giving me  firefly  vibes  and maybe this isn t as much of a hot take as it used to be  but  firefly  is overrated  and joss whedaon has always been overrated 

pretty sure i mentioned this in my first watch through  but i really wish some of the romulans we see here on vashti would have had the mourning tattoos we see the crew of the narada wearing in st 09  not a lot  but one or two in the background would have helped to cement the connection between the evacuation efforts the show is depicting in the flashback  and the destruction of romulus depicted there 

the term  sisterboy  is a wild thing to include in a star trek episode that came out in 2020  also  picard wearing plantation owner cosplay when he beams down to the colony is in interesting choice  they might as well have just given the dude a pith helmet 

introducing the qowat milat into canon is great  one of the oft observed issues with star trek is how non humans tend towards mono culture  all klingons are one way  and all vulcans another  say what you will about the newer iterations of the franchise  one of the best things they ve done is diversify all these familiar faces in the galaxy  and as much as i might joke about romulan nunjas  i am very happy about their inclusion 

 man can t even take a guilt trip without a starship   is an absolute banger of a line  10 10  no notes 

santiago cabrera s turns as all the holograms aboard la sirena is wonderful  i really hope that s an element of the series that survives to the upcoming seasons 

there is something about narek that sucks all the oxygen out of every scene he s in  he s obviously supposed to be enigmatic and mysterious  but the character just comes off as a fuckboy  watching him slide around the corridor of the borg cube  i can t imagine any scenario where he starts talking and every other character in the room doesn t immediately start checking their padds to see the time so they can make an exit 

nothing like seeing a revamped tos romulan bop to bring the spirits back up  gorgeous  sadly  it also makes me wish i was watching  balance of terror  instead 

i forgot about elnor wanting to see a cat  seems like the kind of thing they set up that would have had a payoff by the end of the season but it never did  maybe it will come back around in the upcoming seasons 

there s something about the romulan thugs walking around with swords on their hips  especially swords that the prop department just grabbed from whatever was available given the basket hilts don t in any way communicate romulan design  that doesn t work for me  obviously the intent here is to invoke the three musketeers that picard was introducing young elnor to in the flashback  but the question is to what purpose  like  this former senator is caring a disruptor pistol  so the sword is not a display of strength  and if they wanted the romulans to have a melee weapon  why not create something distinctly to them  i m not suggesting they go as far as introduce something as distinct as a bat leth  but if they re going to carry swords make them not look like something you d find in a  pirates of the caribbean  movie 

picard going off an elnor for killing the senator seems like misdirected anger  what did he think was going to happen when he asked a dude who group up in an order of warriors whose primary mode of problem solving is sword 

fuckin  jeepers  the only thing worse than narek is narek and narissa together  we get it  she s creepy  they do mention the possibility of soji  activating  though  which was is a term i didn t think got used outside the pilot episode  so apparently i was wrong 

chopping up the bop seems like a personal affront  i ll get over it though  because no doubt the only reason they didn t actually just destroy it  and made such a big deal about this kar kantar warlord is that he s going to return later in the season with the ship repaired  looking to exact revenge  right  oh  that doesn t happen  guess we re just leaving every one of chekhov s guns on the shelf 

the first time i watched this episode  i saw jeri ryan s name in the credits  but forgot by the time seven actually appears at the end  it is still funny to me how hard they go trying to misdirect the audience by referring to the pilot of the unknown ship with male pronouns only for seven to be the one to beam aboard at the end   what  a woman  gasp  

 amp nbsp   
   high point  i joke  but the fight between la sirena and the bop is great  and i especially enjoy the introduction of the emmet the emergency tactical hologram   
   low point  i don t think i could overstate at this point how detrimental narek being on screen is to my enjoyment of this episode   
   verdict  meh  there s a lot of peaks and valleys here  once again  i wish we were in the story of the flashback at the beginning of the episode as opposed to the present being told  even though i think there are some misses  i really enjoy and appreciate world building out the romulans  and the introduction of the qowat milat  on the other hand  elnor might as well be one of the non sentient worker synths for all the personality he has  every time we visit the artifact it is a struggle to pay attention to the screen  but getting the battle with the bop at the end is like a delicious treat  all in all  probably my least favourite episode of the rewatch so far 

___

1x05    stardust city rag   

   episode 

before i even press play  i m looking forward to this one  because i remember it being one of my favourite episodes of the season  i know that s not exactly a popular opinion  but i ve always enjoyed what i consider the fun ones   a piece of the action  is like a top three tos episode as far as i m concerned  and i love the ferengi episodes of ds9  except  profit and lace  which started bad and did not age well 

i really hate killing off an established character to motivate another for revenge  like  even someone like icheb    whom i refuse to believe has any actual fans  because what is there to be a fan of     i would rather just not have show up than have them get killed on screen  it just seems cheap  in the past i ve gotten into arguments with people claiming it s necessary to establish stakes or bring other characters together  but it really shouldn t be  getting ahead of myself here  but what does icheb s death actually add to the story  seven wants vengeance against bjayzl  but it is established that seven is already a member of the fenris rangers during the flashback  so she s already motivated to take down the crime boss destabilizing the region and dealing in black market borg bits  keep the stuff about how she and bjayzl had a relationship but bjayzl betrayed seven for personal gain  that works  killing icheb only adds motivation for seven to murder bjayzl at the end of the episode  and i would argue that part of the episode does not work 

all that aside   where s your cortical node  buddy   is both funny  and a good callback 

necar zadegan looks so much like mirina sirtis to me that it is distracting 

the holographic pop up ads for the crew is a fun bit  especially elnor s disappointment that he didn t get one  though raffi s orion drug dealer wearing tie dye is bizarre  obviously it s short hand for the sake of the audience  but in the context of the show does it have any possible resonance with the characters  also  i really want to know what seven s advert was for 

always love a good heist planning session intercut with the actual operation  classic  and done particularly well here  of course  jonathan frakes directed this episode  so i m not surprised that i like the construction 

the scene with raffi and her son is heartbreaking  there have been a few interviews with michelle hurd where she spoke about how she was interested in the role of raffi because she wanted the opportunity to portray how someone who is broken  whom society would prefer to discard  is still able to contribute  i think she does an amazing job  and this scene the genuine hurt coming from raffi is palpable  

rios sure does have a lot of guns for someone who presumably does mostly cargo transport 

i really appreciate the brief conversation seven and picard have about their humanity as ex borg  but then the episode flips that table by having seven beam back down to do the murders she was just talked out of comitting  and it doesn t work  the episode wants to have it both ways  and it simply cannot 

unlike icheb s flashback death  maddox s death does work because it s done to progress the story  and not provide some flimsy motivation for another character

   high point  michelle hurd is great this entire episode  and i have to give an honourable mention to the fact that there was no time spent on the artifact   
   low point  not only do i think having seven beam back down to freecloud clangs tonally  her wield two phaser rifles one handed and gunning down various goons like the punisher is action movie schlock   
   verdict  i ve already said that i m rather positively disposed towards this episode  though the rewatch has made me realise that i was focusing on the good and ignoring the things that don t work for me  i still like it  but i don t think it s as good as  the end is the beginning  or  napenthe  

___

1x06      the impossible box   

   episode 

one of the frustrating things about star trek is that the creators recognise the need for mental health care    there are ship s consulars  and psychiatrists serving aboard ship  going all the way back to  where no man has gone before     but also find it necessary for characters to insist they don t need help dealing with their trauma  it happens so much ldecks made a joke about it  and here we have picard blowing up at agnes regarding the ex borg  when he himself is one  and we just had the scene between him and seven last episode  in  i  borg  he was still dealing with that trauma  but was able to recognise hugh s humanity  then in  first contact  he s giving orders to kill former officers because it would be doing them a favour  for a show that recognises how much picard developed over tng  learning to accept and even like kids  learning to be able to be open with his crew  the fact that he s still having breakdowns about the borg seems like a missed opportunity 

so  in one of his instagram q amp as  michael chabon claimed that it was intended that raffi and captain emmy were supposed to have had a romantic relationship in the past  if that s the case  it really does not come across in the scene where raffi puts in the call for a favour  their dialogue might be kind of flirty  but that s it  the fact that raffi burns another bridge with her old life for picard s mission is rough  and for him to have the audacity to applaud her after the fact   my biggest take away from this season is i just want raffi to be okay and have a good life 

isa briones  scene where soji is scanning her room and it keeps giving her the same result works really well  it s unfortunate that the character is paired with narek so often  because his fuckboy energy really obscures how good she is 

hugh and picard s hug is so palpable  hugh works so much better as an ex borg than he ever did as a borg  but i suppose without the one we wouldn t get the other 

 appearance  human  from earth   it s very funny to me that picard is using that as his description for soji when other than the borg bits  hugh himself    and many other trek species    looks indistinguishable from human  despite the fact that he very likely is not 

picard s shift form shouting   the borg don t change  they metastasize   at agnes to   you re showing what the borg are  they re victims   in a single episode is a wild swing  especially seeing as this is something he should have come to terms with literally decades ago  if picard is supposed too be the audience s window into this story  as we have to assume he is based on the fac that it s his name on the show  then he really should have a more consistent characterization  now  they could play his mood swings off as a result of the abnormality in his brain  but they don t  and if they did it would need to be addressed 

as much as i dislike narek  the romulan mediation scene is pretty good  more romulan world building is always welcome  and the interplay between the dream and narek s guiding soji works really well  his betrayal feels like actual progress in the story  and i do like soji tearing her way through the floor to escape the radiation 

fleeing through the cube to the queen cell is pretty good  and i like the fact that elnor finally gets the opportunity to do something  however  there s something extremely corny about ending the episode with him asking the pursuers to choose to live  obviously it s already been established as a qowat milat thing  and his calling card in the series  but i couldn t help but chuckle and it kind of ruined the tension of the cliffhanger 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  hugh and picard s reunion   
   low point  narissa and narek s scene near the beginning of the episode not only is a narissa and narek scene  but the metaphor of opening the romulibik s cube is terribly on the nose   
   verdict  another mixed bag  there s enough good moments to string the episode along  but nothing is great  and the two scenes with picard s views on the borg might as well have been written by different people ",1646138803,startrek
i watched all the tng movies over the course of february ,"i watched all the tos movies recently  and i made a post on that which i ll link in the comments  so i thought i d do the same for the tng movies  

brief reviews and ratings  
 i should preface this by saying that tng is my least favourite of all the trek shows  even the modern ones  despite it being my first  i don t know why  i ve just never connected with the crew of the enterprise d f as much as i have with the casts of all the other shows 

generations  6 10   this was    perfectly alright  the first 15 minutes were good but then it just goes from good to  okay   robert and rené s deaths felt completely unnecessary and unearned  i don t like what they did with kirk  trapping him in the nexus for so many years and then bringing him back just to kill him   but i m not mad about it  he went out saving the galaxy  the scenes with kirk and picard in the nexus were legendary though  the whole movie was worth it just for those scenes  and data with the emotion chip was hilarious  i have the  life forms  scene saved on my phone  

first contact  9 10   what a good fucking movie  so much fun  i didn t like the weirdly sexual stuff with the borg queen but apart from that  amazing stuff  this is the most compelling picard has been since family  in my opinion  if i had to choose a trek movie to rewatch  it would be either this  voyage home  or undiscovered country  i also loved the cameo from the emh and ethan phillips  

insurrection  5 10   again  this was perfectly  alright   it just felt like an extended tng episode  

nemesis  3 10   what the hell happened here  the first half of the movie was okay  even interesting  but then the second half just    ugh  the stuff with troi was awful  tom hardy was totally wasted  and acted pretty badly   and i could complain but let s not waste the whole post on it  the wedding scene and janeway s cameo were the best parts  

that s it  some thoughts 
pretty much all the movies felt like they could be two part tng episodes  i think they really failed to do meaningful characterwork like the tos movies did apart from in first contact  

i also didn t like how all the movies were basically picard and data centred  the tos movies were also heavily centred on kirk and spock but that status quo was carried over from the show  whereas in tng it properly focused on the rest of the ensemble cast  which doesn t carry over to the the movies  yeah  troi and riker get married  but apart from that they  and the other cast members  feel like set dressing while picard and data get all the interesting stuff  and even that interesting stuff isn t that good  it felt like they were just retreading old ground 

also  glad to see the voyager cast getting a lot of love but where are my boys and girls from ds9  come on  

now i m gonna go and try to finish picard in time to catch at least episode 2 or 3 of season 2  i ll probably watch the kelvin movies    at some point  see you all then ",1646129121,startrek

can we have a new rule  nobody should be allowed to claim that morn didn t talk,"i have seen an occasional post that referenced the idea that we never saw morn talking  we must have some cardassian infiltrators or something  because that is obviously a lie  it s easy to disprove    just watch any time any character describes morn    they will inevitably mention how morn never shuts up

picard ep  1 shows the klingon high council ,"when introducing the interview with the federation news network  they have a little reel showing stills of jean luc being amazing  one of them  which was noting his skills in diplomacy  is a scene from sins of the father  tng 3 17  picard wasn t negotiating for the federation in this episode  but that s beside the point of this post  

the angle of the still shows that the camera would be to the right and slightly below k mpec  which is a generic klingon  he does not bare any emblems of any specific house that i can see  the klingon to the left of k mpec does have two emblems  which might lead me to believe this is indeed k mpec s personal guard or advisor  his right hand  so to speak

question for zoomers  does star trek still inspire people to want to be engineers and physicists ,"as somebody that had sci fi make want me to want to be an engineer  but things didn t turn out that way due to personal issues  i m curious if it still does that for zoomers especially if they never seen pre abrams star trek 


it s mostly older star trek that makes me turn engineering gears in my head 


dr  phlox s sick bay having something that looks like like  alien homeopathy  on the surface makes sense because a lot of modern medicine is derived from nature   penicillin is a bread mold  imagine alien penicillin  enterprise still using cfl lcds makes sense because there were probably printed books on the subject and it would make sense oled is mostly stored on hard drives that could be emp d if wwiii ever breaks out  voyager s bio gel is a wetware computer  tng s iso linear circuits sound like application specific glue logic even tos  analog futurism makes me think how transporters were inspired by analog holography and recording an interference pattern and decoding it back to an image and the 23rd century being analog might make sense if you want to quarantine a computer virus 


do zoomers get inspired by star trek from 2009  to think about engineering and physics as much as i just thought of it from older trek and if so  is there anything exclusive to newer star trek that you can t get in more classic star trek ",1646113615,startrek

the  un star trek  star trek shows i want to see,"star trek  the romulan war 

basically season 5 to 7 of star trek  enterprise  but i want it to be like how the dominion war was portrayed in ds9  but probably even darker  this is the most  star trek  like of the shows i am proposing  but it does stray a lot from its message as it s really a show about war  

star trek  gary seven 

this is basically what  assignment  earth  was setting up  i want this show to be about gary seven  roberta lincoln and isis and their adventures in the 20th and early 21st century  adapting elements from beta canon  the show s only connection to star trek as a whole is that it s set in the same universe  tonally  it could be very  un star trek  like and is more like an action spy show than anything  

star trek  the eugenics wars

could cross over with gary seven  this show is basically an adaptation of the eugenics wars novels by greg cox  where the eugenics wars are a series of secret wars or events that are covered up as real world events in the 1990s  

star trek  world war 3

star trek criticism should be discussed  not banned,"we all love star trek  and one of the things that sets star trek apart from other sci fi franchises is its optimistic view of the future  that said  start trek  as produced by modern day humans  is  not  perfect  by that  i mean aspects of production design  character dialogue  conceptual continuity  etc  

yet  almost on a daily basis there is a post on r star_trek describing how someone got perma banned from  this  sub just for offering light criticism of some aspect of a current show  this seems silly  we all love star trek  so we should all be able to freely   discuss   what we feel to be both the strengths  and  weaknesses of any show film  it does not matter if we all agree  indeed  the best discussions always involve some dissent  some give and take  

an echo chamber of positivity enforced in a draconian manner is boring and unproductive  discussing how star trek could be  better  is not being negative  it is being constructive  i might like this character s arc  and you might hate it  both opinions are valid  and in true star trek fashion  both should be brought to the table for discussion ",1646093585,startrek

if they are having almost constant energy problems  to the point that they have to limit the use of replicators  why do they keep using the holodeck  if the situation is so dire  shouldn t they use all available energy for vital operations and not waste it around like that 
the only sensible reason is that the absence of recreational holographic programs would make the crew much more miserable and depressed  but they could just limit the use of the holodecks  like they do with replicator  and save some energy

however  i can t help but think of other options 

  dela  translates as  to be complete or satisfied  in zulu  which could go with how lonely how scotty and uhura were during the show until they got together  not to mention i m a sucker for the late johnny clegg s song

  aida   reward  in swahili  got this from the tim rice musical 

  crystal  as this oc would be born on the enterprise  scotty would suggest this after the dilithium crystals  the ship s fuel

picard season one  binge rewatch   chapter one,"i wanted to rewatch season one of  picard  before season two begins  but i overall i did not actually enjoy season one  so i ve been putting it off  so  let s take the cellophane off the blu ray that i received as a christmas gift 14 months ago and do a binge watch 

___

   remembrance   

   deleted scene   

the blu ray has a deleted scene for this episode featuring picard using his spyglass cane  and catching one of the human workers in the vineyard mocking the romulans by pantomiming pointed ears with his hands  laris also sees the worker and looks hurt by his mockery  picard threatens to sack the labourer and everyone else involved in the mockery 

it s an interesting scene  though one i m glad was cut  the ever present question of just how labour works in the future of the 24th century remains  while i am firmly in the camp that believes money exists in star trek even while wealth is not a driving concern  it is still tonally jarring to portray picard as a patrician land holder  lording over the labourers working his vineyard  and  while obviously there are still examples of anti alien prejudice throughout star trek  here it clangs and i don t think serves to fit the story they re telling 

 amp nbsp   
   commentary track 

this is one of two episodes in the season to have a commentary track  normally i love this feature in television and movies  but i have seen it implemented so poorly as it is here 

first off  there are five people on the track  kurtzman  goldsman  chabon  beyers  and culpepper  that s a bunch  but not really a problem in and of itself  the issue is that they recorded these commentaries remotely during the pandemic  and decided to implement the video recordings into the episode  so at times when someone is speaking  the episode itself will minimize and instead we ll get a webcam view of akiva goldsman s bedroom as he talks about the logistical difficulties putting the episode together  also  when i listen to a commentary track  i like to put on the subtitles for the episode so i can still follow along what s happening on screen while the commentary talks over top of the show  however  turning on the subtitles with the commentary ended up showing subtitles for the commentary  there are subtitles for the episode itself  but no way that i can find to access that while the commentary is active 

absolutely terrible execution  making difficult to follow along on the episode because the picture keeps getting minimized  and the audio is being supplanted by the commentary with no easy means of knowing what s being said by the characters at any given moment 

the commentary itself isn t particularly interesting or worthwhile  there s a few interesting facts about making the episode  and a whole lot of back patting for having made it 

 amp nbsp   
   the episode 
	
i still love this opening dream sequence in ten forward  even with data looking like he s on the tail end of a month long bender  ultimately the season is as much about data as it is picard  and this scene really sets the tone 

one of the things learned from the commentary track is that the scene in dahj s apartment was filmed after the rest of the episode  and wasn t in the original script  originally she was just supposed to appear at château picard  but it didn t work as well as they d thought  and i think that instinct was good 

rewatching this episode for the first time since it aired  one of the things that stood out to me is the tal shiar baddies start yelling  she s activating  right before dhaj kicks the tar out of them  and i m fairly certain that term isn t used regarding the synths at any later point in the season  it makes me wonder if there was a dropped plot at some point where more than just dahj and soji had been sent out into the galaxy  and the tal shiar had encountered other synths that went through this process  or maybe it was just decided in the moment it was a cool thing for them to say 

i really wish we knew more about the interviewer  and why she was the one picard or laris and zhaban choose for the occasion  surely she was vetted before the fact  the scene only makes sense if richter has a reputation for good journalism and she wasn t interested in doing a puff piece for picard s ego 

dhaj arriving at château picard and then disappearing in the morning is so much treading water  this is poor pacing 

the fight scene leading up to dhaj s death is a lot of fun  tng would occasionally hint at just how scary data could be  we see how strong he is  and in episodes like  a fistful of datas  it s mentioned how fast and accurate he is  seeing those abilities realised with modern effects is neat 

i really like allison pill as agnes jurati  but something is off about the trip to daystrom  a lot of it is exposition for the sake of the audience  but i feel like they could have used this opportunity to better explore some specific points  first  that the synths we later see on mars are unequivocally not sentient  jurati says that the research is still no where near making a fully sentient synthetic  but i would like for it to have been even more explicit  because apparently that was not enough for some viewers  second  they keep talking about how unique data was  completely glossing over noonian soong s other successes such as lore and juliana tainer  they also keep dancing around any mention of lal by talking about how data always wanted a daughter 

i know the fear was that too much exposition would be overwhelming for new viewers  but for those of us familiar with tng  the lack of any mention of lore in this story is a huge sore thumb  by allowing that fear of alienating the audience less familiar with the source material to dictate what was included in the story  i can t help but feel as though they were operating with one hand tied behind their collective back  so to speak  either have a story which goes all in on revisiting these topics and trust that your audience is smart enough to follow along  or don t rely on the past so heavily  but this half measure serves no one 

the final scene of the episode starts off great  narek seems genuinely threatening for about ten seconds  then he starts talking  one of the things he mentions is having had a brother that passed  and at this point it seems like an important plot point which is going to be mentioned again in the future  but with the power of hindsight we know this brother is never mentioned again  maybe it s just a lie to ingratiate himself with soji  but it feels like one of many dangling plot threads that suffuse this season 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  any time laris is on screen   
   low point  the bafflingly implemented commentary track   
   verdict  i did  and still do  like the episode  though with the hindsight afforded by having seen the entire season  it is clear that a lot of the problems i eventually came to have with show began here 

___

   maps and legends   

   episode 

i recently saw some concept art for the wallenberg class tugs introduced at the start of the episode where it had a saucer section which made it more closely resemble the starship boats with which we re familiar  and while normally i am pro saucer section  i think that if form is to follow function this makes a lot of sense  a tugboat doesn t need to have extensive living quarters or science labs  or anything else that most federation ships we see store in the saucer  room for a small crew and some big engines and it s good to go  it also makes sense that if the federation is dedicating itself to rolling these off the assembly line they d go with a form factor that uses fewer resources  and not having to produce all the tritanium for a saucer shaped hull probably makes a lot of sense  i like it 

what i don t like is the fact that all these ships are assembled at mars  this is a nitpick for sure  but the federation has committed itself to evacuate 900 million romulans  a lot of these ships look ready to go  so why are they not going  the one thing we know about the romulans is that as a culture they are paranoid  so i can t imagine that suddenly having a fleet of hundreds of starfleet ships  even rescue ships  arrive in their skies all at once would not incite further panic  we know picard is out there in the uss verity already relocating folks  so if why are these tugs just chilling in orbit  probably some logistical issue  but it s never made explicitly clear 

anyways  moving past the first 30 seconds of the episode  

i m curious about what the intent was with picard s doctor friend  it s established here that they served on the stargazer together  but his tone just seems so off  like  i get that he s concerned about picard given the brain abnormality  but he comes off as almost frightened 

also  having a the brain abnormality return as a callback to all good things is fine  but i feel like the way it s used throughout this season really drops the ball  but that s getting ahead of myself 

i don t care what anyone thinks  admiral clancy rules  for picard to just roll into her office  completely full of himself  expecting to be reinstated  given a ship and crew  and offering nothing in return but to deign to be demoted to captain  after having just gone on the federation news and badmouthing starfleet  clancy is right to call him out on it  and we see later that she s not unreasonable  when picard provides actual evidence as opposed to what must sound like wild theories  she immediately sends help  i liked clancy when i first saw the episode  and iike her even more now  the fact that i recently learned ann magnuson was in a glam metal band called vulcan death grip doesn t hurt  either 

 the federation does not get to decide if a species lives or dies   this line has never sat right with me  we ve seen picard argue on more than one occasion that the prime directive dictates that the federation should allow a species to die if they don t meet some arbitrary technological benchmark  and while his views on the subject may have changed over the years  the dialogue here does not acknowledge that in any way  it makes this bit of the exchange clang for me  and i wish they d found a better way for picard to communicate his position here 

this sarcastic romulan overseer guy is great  he should have had a larger role to play in the season 

i d like to see the character bible s notes for narissa  does it just read   romulan cersi lannister   like  i m not entirely opposed to the character s whole vibe  except the weird relationship between her and narek seems out of left field for a star trek story  in these early episodes i was able to rationalize it away as zhat vash agents must all simply refer to one another as siblings  but then they make it clear later in the season that nope  they re just brother and sister  seems like a cheap way to make narissa come off as more despicable 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  clancy chewing out picard  great stuff   
   low point  it is a fight to pay attention whenever the episode ventures to the artifact  i m glad they didn t try to mystery box it by having the audience learn at the same time picard does that soji is on a borg cube  but man do i wish i cared about anything that happens on the cube   
   verdict  feels a lot like moving all the pieces into place  but to strain that analogy a bit  just like if setting up a board game takes to long it can dampen the fun of actually getting into the game  i feel like there s not enough actually happening here   lost and found   and  the end is the beginning  were originally one episode which ended up being split in two due to running over time  and maybe that was the wrong decision  sometimes less is more 

___ 

   the end is the beginning   

   episode 

so  right off the hop  i want to nitpick and picard s statement that   all synthetic lifeforms are banned throughout the federation immediately    lifeform  would seem to be a misnomer here  because we know that a500 androids that were used on mars were not   alive   not in the same way that data was  or soji is  obviously the fear here on the part of the federation is that a non sapient artificial intelligence would spontaneously develop sapience in the same way that the exocomps or moriarty did  but i feel like not using clear terminology is obfuscating the intent that the show is trying too communicate to the audience 

unfortunately the synth ban is one of the flimiser aspects of this season  and it s foundational to it  watching it again with the hindsight of having already seen the entire season just makes it more frustrating 

raffi says that there are billions of people in what will be the burst radius of the supernova  and i wish the episode gave more specific numbers  we know the federation was committed to evacuating 900 million  but billions implies at least double that  and likely a great deal more  so what other evacuation effort was there  how many people were the romulans able to evacuate themselves  what was the federation plan for non romulans in the blast radius  obviously these sorts of logistical issues of the evacuation aren t something the show choose to explore with any depth  but that sort of thing would be very interesting to me 

watching this opening scene really makes think of the show that might have been  a season that was actually about the romulan evacuation  and subsequent refugee crisis  perhaps that would be less ambitious  but it s what i wanted when we first learned that the show would confirm that the romulan supernova was still prime continuity  ah  well 

a connection that i missed in my first watch is that here soji claims before she was assimilated  ramdha was the foremost expert on ancient romulan myth  and at the end of the season narek  her nephew  gives an exposition dump on those same myths to the la sirena crew  presumably he learned a lot of what he knows from his aunt  that s pretty good 

i will admit that i was not excited to see hugh return  while some people claim that  first contact  was where the borg became toothless  and others believe it was voy  i m firmly of the opinion that every borg appearance from  i  borg  onward weakens the concept  but by the end of this season hugh was one of my favourite characters 

picard meeting rios while he has a bit of shrapnel sticking out of his shoulder is all very dramatic and makes him look like a badass  but what if it s staged to give a potential client  picard  the impression that he s a badass  because otherwise this bit is just silly 

the scene of the tal shiar death squad attacking the château is great  i love the fact that laris and zhaban have squirreled away so many weapons just in their living quarters  you can take the girl out of the ultra paranoid state secret police  so on and so forth 

when i was a kid watching tos and tng the romulans were my favourite adversary for the starfleets    mostly because i thought the bop looked cooler than the klingon d7    and despite all its flaws  i really love how pic has expanded on them as a culture  there are some weird bits  like laris  claim that they have no artificial intelligence  but all the stuff in this episode with the false front door and ramdha s breakdown is really neat 

 amp nbsp   
   high point  definitely the fight at château picard   
   low point  where was number one during the fight at the château  why   was i   were we the audience denied seeing a very good boy tackle some tal shiar goon  unwatchable

more discovery forgetfulness,so in the most recent episode of discovery the admiral made the comment that the crew was about to go outside of the galaxy and that no one had ever done that before   i don t know if they lost all of their historical records after the burn or what but i imagine i can chalk this up to the writers being lazy and not actually knowing anything about the genre that they re writing for   because just by himself kirk left the galaxy twice   if i remember correctly picard did at least once    also are they going to even remotely touch on the great barrier and will we see any discovery crew members go full gary mitchell upon trying to hit that barrier    i m guessing most of the riders don t even know who gary mitchell is ,1645973334,startrek
24th century humans are abhorred by intra planetary war and it s an automatic disqualification from federation membership  but do said humans ever take an interest in non human intra planetary battles  would it warrant a duck blind from the other major races ,"makes me wonder what other planets  first contact is like    maybe klingons only make first contact once there s inter planetary warfare   

anyway we see o brien and bashir reenacting the battle at the alamo  ww2 etc    but nobody seems to show any interest in non human war   imagine if a planet had similar geography and nation states    would someone be interested in it to the level of seeing if they could lead a battle to blockage something like the bosporus to deny  again  something like  russia access to the black sea  just to see if it works out or not  not just human conflicts

parallels i see between american history of expansion and federation united earth history,"note  take everything with a grain of salt  not a historian by any means  also don t want to say that the federation commited the same humanitarian crimes that americans have during their expansion  

star trek enterprise era 

the formation of federation  it s very similar to the formation of the united states  while there s not exactly a revolutionary war  in size the federation is still quite small  just like the 13 colonies that would become states  

star trek tos era

from watching tos  only tos  i get this sense that this was the frontiersmen era  so this would be america post mexican american war  where it has a lot of land but they haven t quite colonized it yet  which is why the federation is so agressive and protective of it s land  not exactly applies to united states in this case   

the  lost  era 

the lost era including the movie era i feel like has the strongest parallel to american expansion  as in this era the federation grows a lot  but also seems to populate many worlds  while also in some ways manifesting destiny  the federation in this mostly peaceful expansion  which is not exactly true for america tbh  becomes a bit blind to threats due to its version of manifest destiny imo  it s version of manifest destiny being just expanding via economic  technological and political treaties  

tng ds9 era

at this point the expansion of the federation has ended  the tng series and ds9 are the lead up to the dominion war which parallels the first world war in some ways  at the end of first world war  the federation remains as the lone superpower much like america in the 20 s in some ways ",1645943759,startrek

so i just started watching tng a few days ago and i started at season 3 and i really fell in love with  the ensigns of command  for its incredibly high stakes and smart writing   that episode hooked me but the next couple weren t doing the same thing for me so i was like oh no did i speak to soon   then here comes the bonding  where do i start with this episode  i have never been so excited by a tv show  it is so unique  i m speaking broadly i don t know about in the star trek universe  and so emotionally potent   the idea that the people on the enterprise are always putting themselves and families in danger and the kids can t truly decide if they want that or not  the fact that the death of marla aster affects everyone in unique and profound ways  how the kid is having to handle death and try and deal with it at such a young age  troy s careful and gentle approach to helping the kid verses warfs harsh and brash but loving way of helping him  to the aliens motives  which we never see in any show about aliens  and how it just can t understand human emotion   this episode is phenomenal and nobody talks about it   why   my other question is can i get a guide on more philosophical episodes of this show that resemble this episode   thank you to whoever read this far ",1645937551,startrek

star trek  like doctor who  babylon 5  etc  has had a bad track record of predicting late 20th and early 21st century history  it has been firmly established that there was a eugenics war  a nuclear war  and we will have the technology to launch a spacecraft with artificial gravity and suspended animation beds  i m not sure what to call them   tos space seed  by the end of the war these establishments are retcons as tos said these wars took place in the 90 s 

as real time as moved forward the eugenics wars and ww3 has been pushed back to keep to keep the shows and films as our future  given star trek will continue to exist into the foreseeable future and probably for the next thousand years  when there will be the 57th reboot  they will continue to push the events back

help me understand why trill are used as a trans allegory,"in the recent history  of which a time span is too vague for me to recall well   i have seen so many articles written from either an anecdotal or sociopolitical perspective about the relationship of the trill experience  particularly that of dax  as a means of relating to a trans identity or trans life experience  i ve had a hard time digesting this  perhaps coming from the perspective of someone who is firmly cis gender and knowing the trans community in a largely professional and impersonal capacity  so i m posting this not to challenge the idea that the dax story or trills as a whole are relevant to the discussion of the transgender experience  but rather to try and get some more direct perspective when reading articles that discuss this feel a bit preachy at worst  and speaking to one s own community at best 

from my perspective  when i think about how the dax story relates to the trans community  my mind goes to how the symbiont is genderless  they establish pretty early on in ds9 that each blended being is their own identity  so from that perspective i ve seen the idea of going from curzon dax to jadzia dax  for example  as less about changing one s gender identity than it is analogous to carrying on a legacy through oral history  jadzia was never curzon  jadzia only has the memories of curzon  indeed  the division between hosts is made even deeper when jadzia and ezri had experiences communicating with the remnants of their past hosts living on in dax s memory  in that sense  it seems very logical that the symbiosis commission wants host candidates who are of strong enough personality so that it is a true blending and not an overwhelming of the host by the strength of the memories in the symbiont  i think this is very well topped off when jadzia is confronted with her first host initiate evaluation  ending the episode saying   i m not curzon   showing how she is distinguishing herself from the personality and decisions of the last dax host  i never saw that as her living more honestly than in her past  or being able to be more true to herself  she is being confident in her own identity as a link in a chain  i am highlighting some of this not as a total defense of how i see the situation  but to give an example of where my perspective is coming from 

i m open to having my perspective broadened and i don t think that having different opinions has to be a zero sum game  so i may not agree with everything put out there  we get nowhere without discussion  i can acknowledge that i maybe am focusing in on the wrong aspects of this discussion  so i m open to a different aspect to help with my understanding ",1645822503,startrek

it s not just your disregard for canon  the writing on the show is simply atrocious  i know it s science fiction  but it still requires some scientific plausibility  either you aren t listening to your science advisers  or you need to hire actual scientists  because the so called scientific premises for each season     4 for 4     have been  to put it mildly  absolute rubbish  and the dart board generated technobabble doesn t come close to covering up how rubbish they are  more importantly  please hire some writers with at least a modicum of common sense  for instance  if your main character has a phaser  literally up her sleeve  and can render a foe unconscious with a pinch of her fingers  you know  because you wrote her as spock s unknown sister  for no sane reason   please  please  please  don t think the audience so dumb that they won t laugh themselves blue in the face when she body launches herself at said foe  fails to subdue him with a head leg lock before getting stabbed in the thigh  and then uses said phaser to cauterize the wound  your show is chock full of this kind of face palm stupid writing ",1645811911,startrek

the new star trek series  discovery  picard  aren t bad  they are just designed for a different audience ,"i ve seen thousands of posts on facebook about discovery and picard being badly made or just being sjw fan service  so i didn t watch it 

but i got to thinking  most if not all of these people actually complaining about canon inconsistenties like spock having a sister and holograms existing before tos were of an older generation who have watched the older series 

the jokes about tillys weight and burnham crying were coming from a younger generation 

i decided to give both series a chance and while i m only 23 i ve watched all the original  quad  ilogy like tng ds9 voy ent  i ve also watched tos aswell and while i thoroughly enjoyed all of them save for the odd episode here and their i watched them before the new style series were even in concept stages  

but after watching discovery s1 3 i still quite enjoyed it  i just see it as its own self contained story that lends from the original series 

with picard i didn t like some of the choices made with the story  icheb for one  but i still enjoyed it on its own merits  

i just simply think the new style star trek series are for a newer audience with expectations that are drastically different as one would expect with a gap of over a decade between the two ",1645803046,startrek

canon connections  discovery 4x10   the galactic barrier,"  the episode title   the galactic barrier   refers to the energy barrier which surrounds the milky way galaxy  introduced all the way back in the original series  second pilot   where no man has gone before  

  there are a number of translation devices visible on the table at kovich s briefing including   
      a starfleet combadge  circa 2399 first seen in the pic episode   maps and legends   
      a starfleet universal translator  as seen in the tos episode   metamorphasis   
      a starfleet handheld communicator  circa 2266 first introduced in   mudd s women   
      an united earth communicator introduced in the ent pilot   broken bow   

  kovich claims that   vulcans surveyed earth for almost a century before making first contact    official first contact occurred in 2063 as depicted in the events of the movie  first contact   but as shown in  carbon creek   the vulcans began surveying earth in 1957 in response to the launch of sputnik 

  kovich mentions a   three hour tour   of the galaxy  alluding to the tos episode  the galileo seven   where an away team including spock  scotty  and bones was lost during a mission and had to repair their shuttlecraft using only coconuts and palm leafs 

  trying to dissuade president rillak from joining the  uss discovery  crew on their mission  admiral vance declares    they re leaving the galaxy  we ve never done that   which might be true if he s only accounting for the living memory of federation citizens in the 32nd century  excluding those who arrived via time travel  the  uss enterprise  traveled outside the galaxy in  is there in truth no beauty   and the  uss enterprise d  did so as well in  where no one has gone before  

  it was established that the galactic barrier is composed of negative energy in  by any other name  

  tarka claims that the galactic barrier will   fry a frontal cortex     we ve seen in  where no man has gone before  that the energies of galactic barrier can can have a profound impact on those with psychic abilities  and it s possible tarka is saying book s kwejian empathy might make him especially susceptible 

  bryce has a moment with saru where he declares he s excited to be leaving  discovery   according to saru  his time aboard the ship opened up a lot of opportunities for bryce  so it s good that he s following dream to travel to toronto and become a train porter 

  saru shoots his shot with president t rina  previous painfully awkward interactions include geordi s date with christy henshaw in  booby trap   geordi meeting leah brahms in  galaxy s child   and harry kim not being ready for how forward seven of nine would be in  revulsion  

  while travelling into the galactic barrier   discovery  is hit by gamma ray from a radioactive burst  when  enterprise  breached the barrier in  where no man has gone before  spock was unable to detect any radiation 

  in one of tarka s flashbacks  oros has a panic attack  repeating    his head    after an alarm sounds  last season in  scavengers  we saw that the control disks the emerald chain affixes to prisoner s necks include an explosive that can be triggered if someone tries to escape 

  tarka claims that targeting a specific universe with the oros  multiversal transporter would require a massive energy source  in the mirror universe episodes of ds9  inhabitants of the prime and mirror universes could cross over as easy as going down the street for pizza  but it has been established in season three of  discovery  that the mirror universe has drifted too far to reach in the intervening centuries ",1645791263,startrek

why did they add a window and another turbolift to the discovery enterprise ,"i haven t seen discovery so i m not sure if it is ever explained  but why the hell did they add a window and that second turbolift  i understand the change to the enterprise overall was controversial with fans  personally  i can get by some of the changes as artistically updated  but still within canon  but i don t understand why they felt those two changes were necessary 

i understand people say it s more  realistic  but it just conflicts so much  you re telling me starfleet put viewscreens on their ships  then removed them around pike s time  then put them back in from kirk through nemesis before putting windows back  will they make up their mind with the windows 

the second lift if more of an ocd nitpick on my part  if there had ever been any examples of it on the original enterprise before its refit  i wouldn t care as much  

now listen  i m not trying to say  keep the 1960s stuff   though it seemed to work on tng  ds9 and ent  however  some things need to stay consistent  i wouldn t have any issues with discovery itself and older ships having it  but enterprise needs to stay a little more faithful  regardless of artistic changes

do not give eaglemoss your credit card number," 

hi  all  i m a subscriber of the enterprise d build up kit  and y all need  to be warned that if eaglemoss has your credit card number  they will  abuse the ever living heck out of it  lie to you about it  and claim  they told you about it in notes hidden in other topics 

 amp  x200b 

1  without my permission or authorization  eaglemoss decided in  addition to the enterprise d  that i should also be signed up for  occasional  special orders  that automatically get billed and shipped to  me which i didn t order 
2  eaglemoss claims i agreed to this  i did not  and that it s in  the faq about the subscription  i went back and looked  and there s a  mention of it in a section called  what are free gifts   which then also  has a throw away statement under the section about free stuff that they  also are going to send me not free stuff and charge me automatically 
3  when notified about the first  special   i emailed them the same  day and declined it  in october 2021  eaglemoss customer service replied  to the email  proving they received it  they billed me and shipped it  in february 2022 
4  the dates are important because eaglemoss just emailed me and  claimed that they did not receive my cancellation of that special order  until after they shipped it  this is a lie 
5  as an unrelated but similar issue  they recently notified  everyone they would start double billing everyone and double shipping  people by default unless we opted out within like three days of  receiving the email  as a budget conscious person who had recently  paused the subscription to save money  the idea they can just decide to  start double charging me whenever they want is    insane 
6  eaglemoss currently holds a coveted f rating with the better  business bureau  most of the complaints are for charging for unwanted  orders  eaglemoss rarely replies

the mod team of r startrek stands in solidarity the with the trans community and their families,"on february 22  texas governor greg abbott officially directed the texas department of family and protective services to investigate to begin investigating trans children in texas receiving gender affirming care with the intent of prosecuting their parents as child abusers  the directive interprets texas law as such that doctors  nurses  teachers  and other licensed professionals who don t report such  abuses  could themselves be subject to legal repercussions 

this order represents yet another attack on the already oppressed trans community  seeking to intimidate the parents of trans and gender non conforming children into forcing their children to adhere to a societal ideal lest they themselves be subject to investigation which may result in criminal penalty and their children being taken into state custody 

we stand in solidarity with our trans friends  family  and colleagues  with trans children and their families  as fans and moderators  we do not tolerate transphobia or any other forms of bigotry on r startrek  and feel that perspective should apply to the real world as well 

current and former moderators of the subreddit have pooled together   250 to donate to trans lifeline  https   i imgur com lgdwajl png   and we would encourage other members of the community to join us as they re able

that s lt  cdr  nilsson  i wouldn t call her a background character in any shape or form  in fact i d go as far to say she s a side character  now this is what irks me  there s so much more that happens between the lines of the show  she s always in the shadows  you ll never he burnham or saru say  nilsson  prepare the spore drive  she s the spore drive ops officer i only know that because of memory alpha

part of his response is in the next generation  in  encounter at farpoint  i say   why do deserve to be out here  

now realistically writers can t plan out an entire series but isn t it fun to think the this could be why in so many of picard s choices he picks the moral and just way  look at sisko you talks to another commanding officer who betrays starfleet for the maquis and says  i ll have your uniform if you come back  now look at picard going after a friend shooting up cardassians  catches him  turns him  and then tells the cardassians basically i know he s right we re watching you  he did what was technically right and basically betrayed his friend for the moral choice  fans of tng we know there are many more examples  just made me think it s a nice motivator to say look q  we have passed are quick to judge quick to war way",1645651208,startrek

the mirror universe is     weird,"while it is nonetheless fun for both the actors and the audience to see the cast of various shows play over the top evil versions of their regular characters  this mirror universe that has featured in every show but tng and voyager  as far as i can remember  is made stranger and stranger each time the concept is visited 

for one thing  that this universe has a completely different history and everyone acts totally differently  but somehow the exact same individuals who are named the exact same thing are not only born   but they pursue the most similar career path and end up serving on the exact same ships  or   in the very least   they end up interacting with the exact same people 

for that to happen  not only would the extremely unlikely event of the person s same parents have to get together despite the radically different universe   the exact same sperm and egg cell would need to merge in order to create the same person  and the parents would each have to decide to name them the same thing and their life would still need to lead to serving on a starship and they would need to make the decision at roughly the same time and starships by the same name and mostly same design always get put into production 

yet all the characters of this parallel universe dating all the way back act almost the polar opposite way they act in the regular universe to produce such almost identical results  okay  so we have infinite paralell universes and so in the space of infinity there is a chance for even the nearly impossible to somehow still occur 

except   its not identical  the other weird thing is that the terran empire is actually more effective than the federation of planets    somehow  the terrans have this constant relentless predilection to undermining and backstabbing one another  alienating everyone and spreading well founded mistrust  they kill each other over the most short term gains  and its all being headed by a single self centered emperor empress who makes arbitrary decisions based on his her personal whims and is surrounded by people looking to kill him her and seize the throne    a government system that we can very much show does not work  and yet    what is the result 

they have gone to war with the andorians  orions  klingons  romlans  cardassians and everyone else   all at once   and won  star fleet having allied with many other alien races has struggled not to lose wars against half of these alien empires  it nearly got wiped out again and again despite superior cooperation and people being altruistic towards one another  star fleet would always pull out a clutch win  but just barely 

realistically the terran empire ought to have collapsed under its own internal in fighting  in fact  that was precisely what happened in the first episode in tos that featured the concept  yet instead they manage to successfully conquer everything where the federation has struggled  and while maybe some of this could be explained by employing more ruthless  and aggressive battle tactics  it really is difficult to believe that their fragile command structures would allow them to get as far as being in a position to employ such tactics 

overall i am not sure what the take away about the mirror universe is really supposed to be  after all  the message of star trek was supposed to be  imagine how much humanity could accomplish if all nations put their differences aside and cooperated as equals towards the betterment of everyone   a celebration of infinite diversity in infinite combinations  and the federation carries forth that concept by showing how virtually every enemy ultimately ends up getting won over and becoming part of the greater whole 

but then you get this counter example of this universe where everyone is a sadistic  evil nut job and somehow they are even more successful ",1645601876,startrek

as somebody that doesn t like st pic s depressing outlook  i get it,"i only saw the first episode and i think i get it 

st pic is a story about a boy scout captain that kept on drinking the federation kool aid and he noticed it tasted bad a couple times and the couple times he noticed it previously  he just brushed it off as  isolated incidents  and the straw that broke the camel s back was starfleet s reaction to the mars incident  i think his kool aid was only good because picard was supposed to be starfleet s posterchild because the enterprise is a name of legacy and their captains saved starfleet s ass many times in the 23rd century  so starfleet appointed somebody of his values to be the posterchild of the federation to show how  amazing  the federation is and most of the naughty stuff the federation did was under his nose and most of the times picard caught them  it was very easy for the federation to call that an  isolated incident  and threw him a bone in  measure of a man   starfleet hid their true colors from their star captain 


i can see why picard is cynical  imagine being indoctrinated into ideals and built your sense of identity around said ideals and realize the people that taught you what you believe don t believe what they thought you 


starfleet corruption has been around even before tng  kirk witnessed starfleet enslaving people  so this is beyond ds9 darkness  i really don t like the  utopia is actually a dystopia  trope  if i wanted a dystopia  well  i would read the leaked snowden documents ",1645539183,startrek

mirror universe theory,"first of all i want to apologize for my awful grammar  

this is a long one  but i ve seen some discussion around when the prime timeline  and the mirror universe split  and it s been rolling around in my mind for a while  i think the aegis are the answer    a lot of this evidence comes from beta cannon   


so we know the aegis have an interest in preventing world war 3  and they were active well before the 1960 s when we see gary 7 in assignment earth 

so the question is did they fail  did they abandon earth  

i think the answer is no  my theory is that the aegis have the ability to see possible futures  and see the potential impact a fascist earth would have on the galaxy  seeing this they start to abduct humans  maybe around 1937    and genetically modifying them to then generations later send them back to earth  

these agent would be sent to prevent ww3  but not all ww3 s   i think the ww3 they are meant to prevent is one that would have happened closer to world war 2  leading to a more fascist america  

this would have given it more time to for the fascist ideals to become engrained in the culture  the would have led to the government we see referenced in q s trial of humanity as the status quo  and not something to rebel against  meaning that the zephrym cochran in this timeline would be more xenophobic  leading to how first contact went in  in a mirror  darkly   

anyway back to the aegis they didn t fail at preventing world war 3  they couldn t have it was inevitable   the aegis prevented a word war 3 that would have lead to a worse world war 4 that would have then lead the the rise of the terran empire  

so basically the agis pull an even bigger reverse prime directive than we thought  

so that is my theory i give it to you the trekkers of reddit to tear apart ",1645506376,startrek

just wondering who i should be praising here  season 3 is really polished and interesting  they say season 2 was the most chaotic on set  obviously there was a reason roddenberry stepped down  is there any other obvious reason i m missing why season 3 is so damn good  that is where ds9 took off as well so maybe that s just them getting in a groove ",1645503508,startrek

the stakes 
the best episodes and arcs in star trek have been about the characters  not the universe   when the situation is  the evil bad guys are going to frame our captain for murder   my reaction is  oooh   how are they going to figure out this problem    when the situation is  the evil bad guys are going to try to kill all living things in the galaxy   my reaction is  shrug   it s been done  

let s compare some storylines 
disco  start of season 2   what are those red signals   
i thought that this was an interesting story line at first  let s see them try to solve the space mystery 
disco  end of season 2   all life everywhere will die if we don t stop the evil computer 
uh huh   sure   

picard  start of season 1    can picard overcome both an intransigent starfleet as well as his personal trauma and rescue the robot   the storyline has potential  as we are rooting for the character we ve known for so long to return to greatness   
picard  end of season 1   we must stop the robots from contacting the evil robots who will end all life everywhere   oh no  a space octopus tentacle   lucky for us  the evil romulans  who sacrificed billions of their own people to stop synthetic factory workers from being built on mars  didn t use any of their 200 plus ships to drop a bomb on the relatively defenseless hippie robots   
i still have a bad taste in my mouth over that writing decision 
compare this to picard talking to data about life  friendship  mortality     that  to me  was the best part of the season   the best parts of trek are the characters  within the universe   not the universe itself 

while disco and picard try to scare us into being emotionally invested with the biggest stakes possible  the climax of the season finale of lower decks is asking us to wonder how mariner is going to grow as a person and get along with her mother while helping to save the ship 

also  if you ve already announced that the series is picked up for another season  you can t have a storyline saying that humanity or even all biological life forms will be killed by some evil computer or evil robots   it just isn t credible to the audience    the exception that proves the rule is the best of both worlds    alternatively  if you have a show set years before other shows in the timeline  you can t have a storyline saying that all of humanity might die   we know that the crew of discovery can t fail at the end of season 2 because they aren t going to permanently retcon every other star trek show out of existence   we know that whatever picard season 2 does with the timeline  disco is still going to be around a few hundred years later 

while disco and picard have plenty of solid episodes  well written and acted  that are not omigodtheuniverseisgoingtoendunlesswecanrealigntheepsconduitsandreversethepolarityofthestructuralintegrityfieldwhileshoutingveryloudly  unfortunately  that ends up being most of the show 

the benefits of animation in general 
suspension of disbelief is a bit easier for animation as compared to live action  so it is easier to let things slide when the plot points don t make sense 

disco  season 4   let s let the captain and her boyfriend  who is not part of the crew and not part of starfleet  and the crew and starfleet are all ok with him hanging around and joining high level meetings because it serves the plot so therefore we shouldn t ask any obvious questions     go by themselves to break into a jail run by evil fascists  which is probably filled with lots of murderous defense mechanisms  and try to free a bunch of prisoners  who may be dangerous  before the space monster destroys the asteroid  

my reaction   this was a stupid writing decision in a show full of stupid writing decisions and i just don t care anymore if they succeed or fail 

prodigy   let s fly the spaceship while some kid is outside trying to fix something and ignore that it is pretty windy out there and he might fall off   

my reaction   well  to be honest  it is a cartoon show for kids  i guess we can ignore that 

lower decks  season 2 finale   can t we fly around the giant space debris   everyone shouts at once  ok  ok fine 

my reaction   that was amazing    we in the audience know that the tamarian is right  and it is bringing the audience in on the joke     this is how star trek works  and this show is lovingly making fun of that rather ridiculous concept that the writers forget that space has three dimensions 

also a key benefit of animation   alien races that aren t just humans with stuff pasted to their foreheads   voyager especially had the challenge of finding more and more and more ways to glue something onto someone s forehead to make them appear non human   compare this to the characters of prodigy or lower decks   you can t use live action actors to create dal and gwen and rocky and murf and jankom at the same time  it is just too much to ask of a production team   linus in disco is well done  but presumably that isn t so easy to work into production  hence why the character is barely seen   doug jones as saru is fantastic  but there is only one doug jones ",1645502335,startrek

i find it odd that datas case was never once mentioned  seeing as it would surely be a landmark case and even could be used as precedent 

ok holograms and androids are not technically the same  but isn t a hologram really just an android without the body 

for the purpose of determining if they are considered a person with rights  i would argue the are both a programed ai  i baffles me that in 2372 or what ever year it is there they still need to argue this 

they even cover a lot of the same issues  and they wanted to make basically a race of datas to essentially be slaves  isn t that what the doctors  brothers  are now  i know the doctor technically won his case  but still deemed  just a hologram  and personally for a time when we have this federation that considers itself to be more enlightened they are so quick to dismiss holograms as nothing more than a program 

the doctor fulfills all of the criteria of being sentient and should have rights

opinion  tng  ds9  and ent got bad initial reactions because their first seasons weren t good ,"opinions are my own  not talking about voy because that s a whole other can to open 

this has been kicking around in my head for a while  people always point to the bad fan reactions of these shows and say these reactions were short sighted  that fans didnt like something new  i m not saying that isn t 100  true  but i think there s a bigger reason  i say it s because these shows were not good when they started  it wasn t until a few seasons in  all around the third season  funny enough  that the quality of the shows improved and that s when fan opinion changed  

think about it  you re a fan in 1987  you tune into tng  and you watch code of honor  you would be right to think this show was bad  same with move along home or unexpected  these shows we love didn t start out well  they grew into themselves  there is a reason that we rarely talk about the early seasons of these shows with the same fondness as later seasons  

again  i m not saying there weren t fans that hated the shows for the fact that they weren t what came before  i m saying  let s try to see these criticisms with some perspective ",1645406914,startrek
i know trek usually gets good after the 3rd season  but with every discovery season 4 episode ranking below a 6 on imdb  i gotta ask  is it worth watching,i ve yet to start it  and i ve heard a lot of mixed things  i m a big fan of voy  tng  ds9 and and orville  so i m wondering if it s worth starting,1645405947,startrek
discovery sucks balls,"i hated season 3   today i watched the first 3 episodes of season 4 to see if it actually got any better   80  of the episodes are bullshit   nothing gets done   no one cares about the trans people  or any of the other characters   the story of the discovery is lame as nothing actually gets done   the whole story seems forced and worthless   this easily is the worst star trek show ever made

the federation has a moral duty to save the terran empire ,"the terran empire only fell because prime kirk filled mirror spock s head with federation values  this interfered with events in the alternate universe and would be a breach of the prime directive  

in the late 24th century the federation know why and roughly when the terran empire fell and also know how to cross between universes  they also know how to time travel 

they have a moral duty to save the empire from federation interference  

it also shouldn t damage the prime timeline as altering history in one universe doesn t effect all other universes

but we get zero ds9 cast unless you count the defiant appearing at the start of first contact 


so what gives  i know the sub has discussed if other casts should have had a movie  and also what first contact specifically might have been like with more of the ds9 characters included  but i m just wondering if the cast had pissed off the producers somehow for them not to be worked in briefly one way or another  i mean how easy would it have been to include armin shimerman somewhere like they did with ethan phillips  ",1645400565,startrek
need help on this crossover of  trek    star wars  and  doctor who  ," i need some advice  i ve been trying to write a multi crossover story 

for context  uhura and scotty got together and had a child in between  tos  and  motion picture   however  a year before the film  specifically 2272   the then two year old child  penda  uhura s sister samara and her brother in law  yafeu  hopped aboard lunar shuttle 94  a shuttlecraft that transported visiting families of crewmembers   with the two pilots and 3 other passengers aboard  lunar shuttle 94 was making its way back to earth when a mysterious wormhole whisked them away  after 4 long years of searching  the federation had the 8 missing passengers presumed dead 

unbeknownst to anyone  lunar shuttle 94 had been transported to the skyriver galaxy  a k a the  star wars  universe   crash landing on tatooine  the shuttle was set ablaze when the hermit  old ben  owen skywalker  ackmena  tork and skywalkers farmhands had helped in the rescue  unfortunately  7 were found dead either from the impact or from the flames  fumes  as for the eighth victim  the toddler was on the brink of death when old ben had used the force to heal her with much success 

sensing that the child  the dead and the craft were not of their world  old ben had a small ship and its 7 hidden away from the empire and buried it all under the sand dunes  and as for the child  now dubbed kari  she s not to know until she s older  in the meantime  ackmena would raise her as her niece with son  laze loneozner  who was 14 at the time along with luke  camie and biggs   serving as her older cousin 

long story short  kari  from the time she was 6 ½ to 12 ½   would go with her family to lothal then to coruscant to be watched over by the now jedi master luke who was made aware of her mysterious origins by old ben s ghost after palpatine s fall  and as kari grew older  luke would look into her memories to get more insight on her past  when the girl turned 19  a series of unfortunate events let her  luke and his companions to uncover the remnants and corpses of lunar shuttle and moved it to luke s jedi temple where it would all be safe from grave robbers and sith lords who could be a threat to kari s home planet 

fast forward to 2293  shortly after  undiscovered country   the enterprise is visited by doctor who  the seventh incarnate to be exact as he d been sent to help with the upcoming journey  he even brought in carol marcus  and her coworkers  jamal scott  uhura s nephew and adopted son  and aida m benga along for the ride  it wasn t long until a magnetic storm sent them to the skyriver galaxy which turned out to be like hoag s object  a galaxy within a galaxy 

through telepathy on part of luke  spock and the seventh doctor  the enterprise managed to get to coruscant where luke  leia and laze told the party everything they knew involving kari  at first  kirk couldn t help but be skeptical  for all he knew she could be a clone  an actress or a salt sucking monster  but luke s team made it perfectly clear that kari isn t a clone  nor a fraud or a monster  she s just a 23 year old girl who s desperate to know if she s  biologically  a part of any family  besides  if luke and his friends wanted something out of the enterprise  they would ve found a more simple  convenient way to get it 

and even though spock and the seventh doctor managed to mind meld kari s brain for her memories  kirk still wants to be sure  so  he sends kari alone to the enterprise where mccoy and chapel can give her a full examination and four dna tests to clear the air 

in the meantime  kirk  spock and the seventh doctor would perform an examination on luke  leia  mara jade and the other jedi involved to get a better insight on the force 

while i m still working on it  i still have issues on a few things  and just so you know  i m only going by the shows and the films  then again for  wars   i m going by the original 6 films with some characters from the sequel trilogy and  legends  being present there  still  i want to go by the stuff made before 1991 for a more realistic feel  like this could ve been made in real life  you know  anyway  here are the problems 

  should i include other  doctor who  companions  in the story s prequel series  set in 2269 2270   the third doctor has to help the enterprise prior to  spearhead from space   during this  it s revealed that uhura s a descendant of glyn williams  the astronaut from  the tenth planet   while scotty s a descendant of the highlander  jamie mccrimmon  which helps the doctor become close friends with scotty s family  with the seventh doctor getting jamie to help with the story  it could mean that our two favorite sci fi scotsman meet but what other purpose could jamie serve 

  then there s susan foreman  i ve been thinking about including her in the story but we already get a telepathic whovian with the doctor  what part could she play 

  should there be tension between the  wars  and  trek  characters  luke would be able to sense their goodness and could telepathically communicate with spock  but would kirk be suspicious of luke s force powers and the jedi  what about the other leaders of the  wars  galaxy  would they be weary of the enterprise  should there even be tension at all 

  how much should the force  itself  help kari in her return to her biological family  i was originally going to make her a force sensitive  with her being the mildred hubble of jedis   but one commenter  rightfully  pointed out how unrealistic that would be as scotty and uhura were normal humans  granted  i had come up with her abilities being either from a recessive gene or due to the enterprise crew finding the jedi to have a high esp level  yet  i don t want her to come off as a mary sue  not to mention it d give a pointless subplot on kirk finding penda kari too dangerous for earth 

  what would the reason be for kirk and the main crew not bringing up penda all this time  was the subject just too depressing to discuss  especially since the shuttle has been missing for so long   would it be too awkward  did they already grieve and move on as it s been years since the shuttle passengers had been presumed dead by the federation  or did they not bring it up for the sake of scotty  uhura and the other families affected  especially with scotty also losing his nephew in  wrath of khan  

  how do i portray the other crew members who lost their families  how would they react to finding penda kari alive  should there be bitterness  should there be joy 

  when should penda kari  uhura and scotty reunite  we know they re going to so should the scene be done earlier or at the end to give it more emotional depth  during the dna test should kirk separate penda kari from her potential parents to avoid the awkwardness and heartbreak if the results were negative 

  would both uhura and scotty have hope of lunar shuttle s survival or should it just be uhura who would have the most faith 

  should i include a flashback where sybok uses the tragedy to brainwash uhura during  final frontier   i was originally going to have sybok s ghost take part in the scotts  reunion but with him no longer being a concern  would the flashback be rendered pointless  to get a look at the flashback  here s the link to it

demo of romulan war and brilliance of enterprise vulcan trilogy ,"hello

i have been rewatching ds9  then voy and finally ent  and realised again that 4th season vulcan trilogy gave us a terrific insight like we have never seen or tought before  and why early series vulcans are really has lack of emotion usually  until this trilogy  we only knew they choose to supress emotions becase they have violent tendencies  we didint really  know repuracations of those tendencies  
now  babel  united and aenar is the showrunners idea to how romulan war would have told if we got later seasons  
we would see starfleet and other ships in action with their bridge etc and then we would see romulan side  back and forth  and maybe some romulan ships would be remotely operated and allies wouldnt even know that  
it would be glorious  if any produders read this  it is time to make this a limited series ",1645362975,startrek
on voyager s emh and the practicalities of away missions," fwiw i love voyager and this is not meant as a  serious  critique 

i have something that has intensely bothered me for years that i need to get off my chest 

on voyager  why the flip are they ever sending the doctor on missions  or letting him leave the ship at all  

as my wife and i were reminded when rewatching  equinox  this evening  his mobile emitter is so shaky it can be turned off via a swift whack from a clipboard  and if it breaks and he gets deleted then the crew have no backup and no full doctor onboard  tom paris is a nurse  not a doc  and is apparently middling at his job   now on one hand  the same could be said of any crew member who dies during an away mission  something as simple as a phaser blast or a misstep on a mountain pass could kill them  so my complaint isn t that the doctor could die in a mundane way  and in many ways the ability for him to  die  the same as others from a broken emitter could have made for some great  human after all  pathos 

but he is their only doctor  and as episodes like  message in a bottle  and  life line  show  the crew is really screwed if he s not around temporarily or  god forbid  something goes wrong that means he never comes back  surely if they insist on sending him out  they d have online qualifications for someone aboard voyager to sit starfleet s equivalent of the umat and become a licensed doctor  they show tom learning some stuff but he doesn t ever get to the doc s level of knowledge  likely because he s part time given his duties at the helm  so why not pick a few crewmen who can learn more medical things to beef out the support staff at least  or better yet see if one or two can spend seven years learning to be a full time doctor  and if not  then why send your only fully  qualified medical practitioner into dangerous settings every other episode 

bottom line  if the doctor had ever had a real easy turn of bad luck on an away mission  for 70  years voyager could have potentially had to cure their crew with leeches and fishing twine ",1645356022,startrek
i ve seen just about everything trek except for tos and tas  it does not really feel like the same show ,"i know there was a lot of time between tos and tng  but the show feels like something completely different  i am guessing that is because of the era in which it was made  also  i suppose it has to do with the creator passing early into tng  so most of what we know as trek was created under a different person 

i am near the end of season 1 and while its not bad  i doubt i would give it a rewatch

who would be your ideal cast for a mid budget  serialized star trek tv show post voyager,"let s say you re the showrunner for a star trek tv show along the same vein as tng and voyager  it s a galaxy class starship in the alpha quadrant so you have a captain  first officer  engineer  doctor  ship counsellor  security chief  chief helmsman  amp  plucky ensign  it doesn t have to be exactly these categories  add or subtract as you wish   who would be your actors  ideally ones you think would be attainable  and give an outline what role they would play 

example 

captain  andre braugher  a human from earth  and was a decorated war hero of the borg  amp  dominion wars  

first officer  ana de la garza  a half romulan half human  handpicked by an admiral over the expressed wishes of the captain  mistrusted by the crew 

security chief  daniel dae kim  formerly of starfleet intelligence  and also a weapons expert 

ship s counselor  peter jacobson  a trill and possibly the only friend to the first officer 

chief medical officer  anna friel  a british medical physician and formerly in a relationship with the chief engineer 

chief engineer  khary payton  a klingon exchange officer who has trouble with life onboard a starfleet vessel

tng preemptive strike,"i hadn t watched this episode since it first aired  and i absolutely love both the writing and the acting  ro s discomfort at the beginning of the episode presages her conflict with her mission as a federation spy on the maquis  and the parallel father figures between picard and macias representing duty and family perfectly establish ro s inner conflict  and the final conversation between ro and picard with the intimation of prostitution illustrated how this mission defiled ro s morality 


when i first watched this episode i remember being disappointed in ro s decision at the end  but i missed all the nuance in both the writing and the acting in this episode  i truly didn t appreciate just how out of place ro felt in starfleet  nor did i appreciate the importance family to her  the episodes of tng that include ro take not her on an arc  but me  ideas that permeate starfleet such as  duty  and  honor  mean very little to someone whose life had been shaped by suspicion  betrayal  and loss  family  more than anything  meant more to ro    and i couldn t be more proud of her ",1645334641,startrek

season 4 starts off with michael having a kirk like failure to grasp that there can be no win scenarios in the first episode  not subtle  given the title   this is underlined by her  gt  saying some very un star fleet things to the president about trusting her gut  justifying her cowboy behaviour  which she gets consequences for in not being selected for promotion   lt 

in rubicon   gt  at several points  michael is almost forced into the no win scenario  most particularly when she  lt   gt  is almost forced into destroying book s ship  saved in the last instant by more intel over the comm   lt 

in the past  i ve found a lot of the behaviour of the   discovery   crew really odd  compared not just to other star trek shows but to other star fleet characters within the show  this is something that s hampered my enjoyment  but i m beginning to think it s coming to resolution now  that i should trust the writing more  and that burnham is going to have a   wrath of khan   level loss at the end of this series that will ground her  and perhaps the crew as a whole ",1645315044,startrek

wasn t one of tng s greatest strengths it s high functioning bureaucracy and professionalism ,"i m sure this has been brought up a ton of times before  but 

  the senior officers were mentally stable and disciplined most of the time  not having low esteem and continuously self doubting  as would be expected on a flagship 
  they were also very professional  capable and reliable  solving problems in true collaboration and discussion  everyone seemed to be captain material 
  everyone also had personal interests they enjoyed or pursued in off hours making it easy to connect 
  the captain was an ideal manager  not a superstar hero that saved the day every time  relied on other more knowledgeable pros in their areas to come up with options  
  in fact  the captain wasn t even allowed to lead away teams most of the time 
  promotions were a thing that was offered and pursued 
  mental health was extremely valued and urged

in summary  it seemed like a well structured  collaborative  positive environment with a ton of collaboration and empowerment  everyone were capable  professional equals who commanded respect

it is absolutely wonderful  i m not sure if it s nostalgia or what but i feel more invested in the characters and story than i have with any other show 

i love the stories  the themes can be very deep at times  generally the characters react how you would expect them to based on their various backgrounds  and the whole experience seems surprisingly wholesome 

its just been such an absolute delight and i figured this would be a good place to share these feelings

are the kelvin movies the star wars prequels of star trek or the star wars sequels in terms of reception ,"so i ve never really star trek before outside of a handful of episodes and wrath of kahn  a few months ago i went to a thrift store and saw a steelbook of into darkness for only a  1  what i didn t know was it had the 2009 movie and into darkness on dvd instead of a blu ray version of into darkness  so i was pretty excited getting two movies for a  1 in a cool case  i watched both  really liked them  bought beyond and really liked it  then watched the original series by checking it out from the library  i even got the star trek video game set between the first and second movie  

so after getting into the franchise i was excited and started talking to a few friends i knew who were fans  but they weren t exactly impressed  they said my experience of the franchise is going to be tainted having see the action packed movies first that butchered the og characters instead of starting with the show  i ll admit i don t remember much of tos outside of a few episodes  they all just kind of blended in  but i enjoyed it and can t wait to see the rest of the original shows  

after having seen it i can understand why people didn t like the kelvin movies  but i didn t think they were that bad  i felt that while they were more action packed and there was more foul language it still felt like tos  just better looking visuals  are they actually bad movies or are they just poorly received because they used the original characters but recasted them as younger  hotter  more action movie actors and i m just missing the point of tos  or are these just star wars esc movies with a star trek skin ",1645290473,startrek

the problem with the new star trek is that it is always saving the galaxy  ,the problem with the new star trek is the high stakes of saving the galaxy  i m not just saying it because i just dislike for prenise i m saying it because it has been established again for the galaxy is  big  the size of the galaxy that was established in tng deep space 9 and voyager is way too big for there to be a logical threat that could attack the entire galaxy  breaking the skin is like putting harry potter spells in star trek  but even if this was excused  the fact discovery is likely going to now save the galaxy or be involved in a galacticwide affair three times is just bogus  even if you assume that the federation is an outlier in that every species only saves the galaxy once  it doesn t make sense that the milky way would still be populated by humanoids if every species encountered a threat to the galaxy because the odds of every single species saving the galaxy once and them still winning is too low ,1645280565,startrek

tarka said he d been working at this for 10 years  and that he needed the power source to  go home   it sounds to me like tarka and his friend were q trapped in mortal bodies  cut off from the continuum  

and won t that be the perfect setup to devastate book  the person he d been helping in order to avenge the destruction of kwejian  is in fact  responsible for the destruction of kweijian  but who knows  if tarka turns out to be a q  and he manages to get back into the continuum  maybe he ll snap his fingers  bring kwejian back  and send 10c packing ",1645201695,startrek

canon connections  discovery 4x09   rubicon,"  the title of the episode   rubicon   is a reference to the idiom    crossing the rubicon    meaning to make a decision from which there is no return  and which is itself an allusion to julius caesar s crossing the rubicon river  precipitating his civil war 

      caesar has been mentioned in trek a number of times  in tos   what are little girls made of     bread and circuses    patterns of force   and  whom gods destroy    a matter of time  in tng  and in ds9   improbable cause   though that was discussing the william shakespear play named for him 

      the ds9 episode   the die is cast   is named for caesar s reported remark    alea iacta est    upon his crossing of the rubicon 

  nhan  rachael ancheril  returns  she was introduced in season two s  brother   and was last seen in season three s  die trying  

  when burnham points out that she and nhan are close  which might make things awkward  nhan assures her and vance that  like many barzan  she places   duty above all    this barzan phrase was first introduced in  the price   and repeated by nhan several times over the course of season two of dis  and certainly not some new aspect of the barzan people we re just learning about this episode 

  when nhan takes burnham and saru aside for a private briefing  burnham turns the conn over to nilsson  though this doesn t necessarily mean nilsson is the  uss discovery s  second officer  it might indicate that s the case  nilsson is played by sara mitich who also played airiam in season one  and was second officer under lorca 

  nhan claims that an analysis of the plans of book s ship has demonstrated a weakness in the freighter  a small thermal exhaust port only two meters wide is unshielded  and small  one maned shuttle will be able to fire a photon torpedo which will start a chain reaction which should destroy the ship  just like bullseyeing sehlats back home on vulcan 

   discovery  launches a weapon meant to blind book s ship s sensors while cloaked  causing only a ripple effect  firing weapons while cloaked has always been a problem  though apparently one solved by the 32nd century  previously we ve only seen chang s prototype bird of prey from  the undiscovered country   the reman  scimitar  from  nemesis  able to fire while cloaked 

      stepping outside of the prime timeline  in the mirror universe the terran empire s  nx 01  was able to fire while maintaining a suliban cloak in  in a mirror darkly   and in the alternate future of  all good things   the klingon attack cruisers were able to fire upon the  uss pasteur  before dropping cloak 

  book ignites a hydrogen cloud with a magnesium charge  hoping to warn off  discovery   in  insurrection   riker developed the riker maneuver  deploying metreon gas at two son a battlecruisers which were then destroyed when their own phasers ignited it 

  the close up of the dma controller reveals it to be a glowing core enclosed by two rotating dodecahedrons  it has been pointed out that it doesn t look entirely dissimilar from the model of the omega molecule shown in  the omega directive  which was a rotating icosahedron with a pulsating core 

  the  uss mitchell  is assigned to observe the location of the dma after its destruction  reporting the arrival of a replacement  presumably the  mitchell  was named for kenneth mitchell  the actor who portrayed kol  kol sha  tenavik  and aurellio in previous seasons of  discovery  as well as voicing three characters in the lds episode   veritas   mitchell has als  the progression of which has limited his ability to continue acting  and even prevented him from returning as tenavik in  star trek online  

      there are no jokes in the canon connections post  because star trek is serious business  but if there was  and i didn t respect the hell out of kenneth mitchell  here is where i claim that the  mitchell  was in fact named after gary mitchell  captain kirk s best friend who developed extra normal powers after the  uss enterprise  traveled beyond the galactic barrier  and then had to be killed by a boulder in  where no man has gone before   then i would make up some claim that gary mitchell returned from the dead and was actually future guy in ent  and is now a celebrated hero in the 32nd century  obviously though that would never happen  and it is ridiculous to even suggest the possibility ",1645186210,startrek

some pyrotechnic effects in the original series look better than later series,"i ve seen all of 90s trek a dozen times but somehow i d only ever seen a handful of tos episodes  i m going through them all now on netflix and discovering some of the pyrotechnic effects in tos look better than later series  

several times when kirk talks a computer into self destructing it ll catch on fire  spew smoke and spray sparks  or another where someone has sabotaged the enterprise and the console catches on fire  there s something more visceral and real about these pyrotechnics than on 90s trek  

i m thinking about failing computers on tng  enterprise  there s a lot of showers of spark effects to show ship damage and sometimes a smoke machine puffing clear white fog out from behind panels  consoles explodes with a dramatic flash of bright white sparks  presumably it s some stock pyro device of gunpowder and magnesium to make a dramatic bang but it somehow doesn t feel as  real  as the 60s pyrotechnics 

i think this is because in the 60s pyrotechnics probably  were  more real  the sabotaged computer catching on fire and billowing grey to black smoke is the set actually burning  the explosion effects feel more visceral probably because they re subject to less safety regulations and they really are more brutal pyrotechnics  there s an explosion that kills a redshirt in episode 2x09 the apple  it looks pretty dangerous and i felt the actor was at a genuine risk of being hurt by the explosion  

obviously the budget and spectacle of ds9 era pyrotechnics is much greater like jake sisko running through a battlefield in 5x04 nor the battle to the strong  but somehow that feels sanitised and clinical and less violent than the explosion from 30  years earlier ",1645101169,startrek

ds9 has held up better than any other trek,"the serialized nature of the later seasons   progressive views on race and relationships   the ferengi as a lense into capitalism  with both pros and cons    the patriot act foreshadowing nature of  the home front    it s a late 2000s show that debuted 6 months after i was born in 1993 

if this series came out today it would be a better revival than dis imo   for me it s the absolute peak of trek   if someone came up to me today and asked which series to start with  i d tell them to start with ds9 and to just google any questions about references to earlier series 

i m just saying i really hope this show gets more references callbacks in upcoming shows   it deserves it ",1645073036,startrek

what if star trek had its own andromeda initiative ,"mass effect always has been a star trek  ripoff   but in a more militarized way  this changed a lot with mass effect andromeda  wich introduced the andromeda initiative  the main object of the initiative was to unite the main powers of the systems alliance on the common goal of mainly  pacificly explore the andromeda galaxy  to explore new worlds  discover new life  new civilizations  etc 

i believe this concept would work in a post picard era  when the federation starfleet is in the need to reaffirm it s intentions as being a scientific exploration driven organization  it would be a breath of fresh for fans and writers  because it would run away from the repetitive romulan klingon picard kirk subjects and themes  it would bring new opportunities to create new worlds  new forms of life  factions  species  anomalies and the bast part is that the federation would be a minority in this new galaxy  with no influence and almost no resources compared to it s milk way counterpart  wich would create racial and political conflict  conflicts that the federation wouldn t have the means to solve these problems in a military way ",1645066957,startrek
the bajoran s are the only human looking alien race the federation seems to care about,"think about how many alien races looked exactly like humans that we saw in tos  tng  ent and even voyager  and the vast majority of them we only see for 1 episode and never again  none of them are ever given much thought 

bajoran s look exactly like humans besides their noses and they re basically treated like the most repressed people in the quadrant  and while they were under occupation  we ve seen so many other 1 episode races involved in war or politics similar to the cardassian bajoran situation  but it only gets 1 episode and is forgotten about as soon as the next ep starts 

it s sort of the same way vulcans decided to help humans when we discovered warp drive  but none of the other human looking aliens  i know most of it is due to the location of the wormhole  but it s always interesting to me the bajoran s are given special treatment  a lot of illusions to real life nazi jews or israeli middle eat situations with real life are obvious too",1645065596,startrek

the federation is rich with latinum,"i see many posts here asking how members of ds9 have money to spend at quarks and how does the federation interact with external races who use latinum etc  etc 

latinum is merely a resource akin to gold  it s mined from planets or nebulas and is hard enough to get that it s valuable 

the federation is massive and well resourced  within its boarders must be ample latinum reserves which they mine and accumulate 

while this currency isn t used internally  it s still used externally  it s distributed as a stipend to crew members on the frontier or used to pay for goods and services with non federation members  

also while there s no monetary use within the federation  when interacting with external non federation money driven races the federation may very well charge them for goods and services  as it would be the logical way to interact with those races   the profit would likely go into the pot of money that is distributed to crew members on the frontier who need to live in those frontier environments where money is used  

said crew members who received a stipend still have a limited supply of latinum whenever it s distributed  and so bartering and betting between each other at quarks etc is still valuable to them 

the system makes sense   latinum is just a valuable resource to which the federation happens to attach no value to  but that doesn t mean they have none of it  or can t interact logically with races that use it ",1645057579,startrek

how would y all feel about the next star trek movie being a sort of remake of the voyage home ,"title kinda says it all  there are those stories going around  as they always seem to  about making a fourth star trek movie in the kelvin timeline with the reboot cast  i know the stories going around a few years ago involved chris hemsworth coming back to play kirk s dad or something like that  but i wanted to discuss one alternative which would be a sort of modern day retelling of the voyage home 

  premise of the original  

for those of you possibly unfamiliar with the voyage home  the basic premise of the movie is that the crew of the enterprise have to go back in time to save the whales  they have to do this because an alien species who were friends with the whales many centuries ago were friends of the whales and are pissed off that humans drove their friends to extinction by the 23rd century  the crew spends some time in 1980s san francisco  get into and out of trouble  grab a couple whales  and then head back to the future  it s amazing  

  worth a shot  

i know fans would get prickly another direct reboot of a previous film  and there would definitely be some problems to avoid  but i think it would be great to see the reboot cast deal with a smaller ish scale issue and focus on them as people and how they view the early 21st century  how does the crew view the 2020s in their universe  here are a few considerations  

  bell riots  

depending on how quickly the next star trek film goes into production  we could expect it to come out in either 2023 or 2024  if the crew were to go  back in time  to the present day san francisco  that would mean the reboot crew would be around at almost the exact same time as the  bell riots  https   memory alpha fandom com wiki bell_riots   the bell riots deal heavily with homelessness  gentrification  and wealth inequality  which are more relevant topics than ever  this could be a great way to have the crew talk about some very socially relevant issues and the ways that humanity eventually overcame some of these issues together  and i mean come on  that timing is just great  

  world war 3  

in the star trek timeline  ww3 begins in in 2026  so going back to 2023 2024 would mean the crew knows that everyone they interact with is about to experience mass destruction  whole cities get wiped off the face of the earth through nuclear war  and hundreds of millions of people are about to die  how does the crew react  do they meet any nice people  learn they will die in the war  and then try to change their fate  do they debate making a bigger change to world history than just taking a few whales  

  budget  

the recent star trek reboot films have had production budgets hovering around  200 million  while making on average  400 million ish  once you factor in marketing costs  the cut theaters take  and the rising pay of the actors who have more star power than when they signed on a decade and a half ago  a high budget star trek film doesn t really make much financial sense  but if they were able to have a huge portion of the movie take place in the present day  paramount could probably save a lot of production costs  

i know something like this would be super unlikely  as it would not necessarily a hugely marketable blockbuster or anything  but it seems like the pieces are there for a really cool star trek story  but what do y all think ",1645052303,startrek

second episode into the original series i am reacquainting  my love for kirk 

he is a bit old fashioned of course  and very much your man s man they liked in the era 

but also has so much charisma  and i love how much early on they are already establishing him as the strategist  he is playing 3d chess with spock and spock is commenting on how his mind is not on the game and gets him in check only for kirk to checkmate him  spock the smartest man on the ship gets out manoeuvred

kirk is the trickster strategist  he makes you think one thing only to pull another  he is the bluffer  the corbomite manoeuvre shows this  can t wait to reach this episode  he shows it again in wrath of khan making khan think he has him trapped buried  tricks the klingons into boarding his ship only to have beamed off the ship just before and set it to blow  which shows he keeps his cool under pressure  he is able to make hard decisions under pressure  

he has the qualities of both mccoy and spock  the passion and heart of mccoy with the logic and reason of spock 

all the captains have their qualities but kirk is the one i would least want to go against in battle  or play poker with 

he us and always shall be  my favourite captain ",1645046412,startrek

is it necessary to watch enterprise before watching modern trek ,"i moved back in with my parents since the pandemic started  i grew up watching the original series  the next generation  and the trek movies  but i had never seen the next generation all the way through from beginning to end  we started tng in august 2020 and finished it in january 2021  we took a little break afterwards to watch other shows  then moved into ds9 and finished it later that year  we started voyager in late october  and we just finished voyager season 5

would i miss anything by watching the new trek shows before i watch enterprise  do i need to watch enterprise to understand details in new trek shows like discovery or lower decks  do you have a recommended order for the rest of the trek shows i have left

should i watch star trek  enterprise before moving on to the new trek shows like lower decks and discovery  is it necessary to watch enterprise before watching modern trek ,"i moved back in with my parents since the pandemic started  i grew up watching the original series  the next generation  and the trek movies  but i had never seen the next generation all the way through from beginning to end  we started tng in august 2020 and finished it in january 2021  we took a little break afterwards to watch other shows  then moved into ds9 and finished it later that year  we started voyager in late october  and we just finished voyager season 5  

when we were done with voyager  we planned on watching picard next  especially since season 2 of picard is about to come out  i am not sure which trek show we should watch next after picard  though  i was thinking we would watch lower decks and prodigy afterwards  the only thing i am worried about is enterprise  we plan on watching all of the trek shows  so we will end up watching enterprise sometime this year  but i am wondering if i need to watch enterprise before moving on to modern trek 

would i miss anything by watching the new trek shows before i watch enterprise  do i need to watch enterprise to understand details in new trek shows like discovery or lower decks  do you have a recommended order for the rest of the trek shows i have left 

i know it is a prequel series  so maybe it is not necessary to see it before the modern trek shows  but i figured i should ask anyways  thanks for the help ",1645030103,startrek

ryker s character development is great ,"by the end of tng ryker was one character that hadn t changed much at all  picard  data  and worf had all had some quite important growth or challenges  including more worf over on ds9  then we have picard s issues with the borg in first contact 

meanwhile ryker is verbally criticised by other characters for staying under picard s wings in the show itself  he fits the jock first officer role reasonably well  what with the chair mounting and smugness over confidence  however there are glimpses of a more social beast underneath with the jazz  and the simmering sexual tensions  however by the end of tng not much has come of that  

in insurrection we see the rekindling of his romance with deanna  however it is only in the last couple of years that we have seen the real potential in ryker s character  when he finally gets his own ship the titan  he really relaxes into the role of captain and becomes somewhat buccaneering  and later he retires and becomes a complete cuddly family man  although he suffers some heartbreak he still clearly has a heart of steel and is ready to come back to active duty at any time  

the softening and growth of his character has been long in the making and subtle in its development  he has gone from a sometimes mildly annoying character to one of my favourites in trek canon ",1645026301,startrek

star trek extended  novel  universe comment,heavily vested in the characters and stories bought forth by the extended universe   some of these characters are even better developed than the traditional television show characters  in my opinion     i have read the novel verse in order with predominantly the the next generation stories at this time  with a few of the ds9 themed stories here and there   and am currently at the very end of coda book ii     and all i can say is   holy crap      this entire series thus far  three book series  is just     nearly too much     so much of everything in it   want to remain spoiler free     but if you want a story with a lot of the old characters  and a ton of the new characters   be sure to check on this series   bring tissues   ,1645024716,startrek

star trek convention concerns,"hey fam   

so my wife and i have attended the creation entertainment star trek convention in vegas annually now for the past 10  years  we were actually pretty shocked to learn they lost the  star trek  license over the pandemic and now another company is handling the  officially licensed  convention 

last years convention in vegas was    okay  i ll totally give them credit that it was still a pandemic year  but there were still a ton of last minute  previously confirmed  cancellations of big names resulting in a pretty anemic lineup compared to years prior  it felt off  and perhaps it was just the pandemic    but being the first year without the star trek license  it definitely felt wrong  i was really not feeling creation s attempt to maintain a star trek atmosphere with their  threll empire  storyline  it felt like you were at a birthday party where the parents decorated with dollar store star trek knock offs  p

now this coming year in 2022  not only has the venue changed to bally s  while the rio was meh  bally s is  super  meh   but they also reduced the number of days from 5 to 3  

looking at the new  official  convention   mission chicago    while also a 3 day convention  it appears on the website they only have   9 guests confirmed with the convention itself only 2 months away  the same company arranges the star trek cruise which seems to have a much better lineup of guests 

curious folks thoughts    it just seems super weird to me that  while it feels like star trek as a franchise is the best it has ever been  convention options seem to be at a low point  maybe we just need to start going on the cruise   ",1645019464,startrek

where should i start reading the books ,"so  sorry i just posted a question about the shows  so i apologize if i am spamming or anything  and if it is against the rules  but just saw another post that gave me a question  i have tos in a book collection  but i have always ignored star trek books when browsing  i did have the unfortunate mind set that star wars was the only acceptable sci fi  luckily at christmas time after the reboot movie came out  my brother s let me stay up and watch it with them   say what you will about the reboot movies  but they are what made me actually dive into star trek once i got a job and started earning my own money and could by consoles and subscribe to networks like amazon and netflix and etc   even then  outside of that said collection of scripts turned into book form for tos  i have still completely ignored star trek books  so  to basically the only place i can talk star trek  i ask where i should start  preferably chronological order  but honestly i would love people s personal opinions as well

has star trek changed that much  new fan perspective ,"hi  i have been watching star trek for two years by now  my first contact was with the kelvin timeline  i loved it  wich motivated me to watch st  discovery  wich i also enjoyed a lot  even if i didn t liked michael as protagonist  poor writing  but i loved tilly optimism and charisma  my favorite character of dis   and obviously i enjoyed the battles  most of the bridge crew and the spaceships  like  a lot  

after watching season 2 of the discovery and meeting the enterprise and mr spock for the first time  in this timeline   i was once again motivated the watch more of it  then i watched the original series  and my god  it s is so good  and for me  still the best series of the saga  even after watching tng and ent  even with some cons  like some bad taste commentaries about woman  wich would sound sexist today  but i tend to ignore because it s from the 60s  

and thinking about what people say about what the series has become  i cannot see how different is the new trek from the old trek beyond the use of cgi  i ve noticed how the themes and main drive of the series still the same  and i think i can counterargument what people say about the new trek using the old trek as the base of my argument 

1  constant conflict and battles 

one of the most reccuring arguments  are that star trek has become too much of a  star wars  clone   but the amount of space battles that appeared in tos can t be ignored  a lot of space encounters involving other factions has resulted in a space battle  like the first encounter with the romulans  scotty starting a bar fight because the klingons  wich are just dirt stained humans here   offended the ship   the  corbomite manouver  encounter    and that s without counting the hundreds of fist fights that happen in almost every episode  so  i can t see how discovery and picard are doing something different in this point specifically  i understand that burnham was impulsive and started a war  but my point is that the problem isn t the war itself  but is that michael wasn t severely punished for that  wich i think is a serious failure from the writers in that moment of the series  wich would saddly occur on other occasions  season 3  

2  progressivism and diversity 

star trek was controversial in the 60s because of it  the first interracial kiss  diversity in the cast  bringing acceptance and good ideals to other  more violent cultures  and i believe that s still the main drive of the series even today  i understand the argument that  diversity for the sake of diversity is bad wokeism   wich i agree in the most cases  but not in star trek  i see a lot of people complaining about female protagonists or black characters  but this sound somewhat racist or sexist  because it isn t the first that this happened in the series  what has changed  you can blame bad writing as much as you want  but saying that star trek is failing because of diversity  wich is the literally what made star trek special in the first place  it s pretty hypocritical  but to be fair  the character that i despise is adira tal  that character was super forced and it was diversity for the sake of it  again  bad writing  not diversity issues  

3  grey morals  

this one is pretty stupid  saying that the federation is somewhat perfect  or everyone in the crew is a perfect human being doesn t make sense at all  a lot of episodes from tos show corrupt fleet officers  racist federation members  trigger finger captains  wich isn t different from what we see from any other star trek series or movie  the grey moral is what make the star trek universe more comprehensive and the characters more relatable  because they are humans  but different from us  they are least trying to do better and improving from every lesson  wich is what discovery tries to do most of the time 

4  the new trek doesn t respect gene roddenberry vision 

i wanna see someone counter this argument  lol   most of gene roddenberry concepts didn t make through the original series  mainly for being too impractical and unrelatable in a writing perspective  but it was his creation  so he used to interfere in the first opportunity that appeared  he wrote only 14 episodes  wich most of them he was a co writer  and the episodes he had the most participation  were some of the worst episodes of the entire tos  he was a amazing world builder  but a horrible writer  wich explain his conflict with many other experienced sci fi writers that worked on star trek at the time   none of his episodes are in the top 10 of critics  and fans  the situation got worse with tng  when he had almost full control of the first two seasons  wich are the most disliked seasons of tng  it had good episodes  but i see that most people agree that the first two seasons are the most boring  when gene died  ironically  it s when star trek blew in popularity  with the writers having more liberty to create a more relatable and believable star trek universe  that defined a whole cultural fenomenom  do not fool yourself  star trek has survived all these decades not because of him  but despite him  most of the series content was made after his death  not before  and to most fans  as i see  everyone loves the controversial  not gene s vision  deep space nine or love what the tng has become after he left ",1644984384,startrek

star trek of the  present day   picard era  should come up with a new antagonistic race ,"i was thinking about the state of intergalactic affairs in the post supernova era  and i realized that the federation has very few political enemies or rivals 

the klingons have been allies for over a century  

the romulan star empire dissolved after the supernova and became the romulan free state  not only are they much weaker than before  but also federation romulan relations seem to be trending for the better  with some setback due to the federation pullout of the relocation 

the borg were crippled by janeway destroying their network in the alpha and beta quadrants 

the cardassians were ravaged by the dominion  leaving the planet to go through political reform and focus on rebuilding 

the dominion were defeated  and odo s presence in the great link is likely to lessen the imperialist tendencies of the founders 

the ferengi are going through progressive cultural reform under the leadership of grand nagus rom 

the xindi  by this time  could very well be federation members 

with all this in mind  i think star trek should introduce a new race or political entity to rival the federation  or they could expand on older races we rarely see  some smaller antagonistic forces that are still around include  gorn  tholians  orions  kzinti  and breen 

what do you guys think  should they create a new race and or expand on an old one ",1644974120,startrek

my dad described tos 1966 as jack kennedy in space  starting tng 1987 again i was surprised by how much space reagan was in there,"as someone born in the early  90s  of course i grew up on tng so it was weird for me to see how how much drastically more progressive for its time tos was as compared to tng  i m on s01e21  the symbiote  and crusher and yar are both just straight up doing a nancy reagan ad   you see wesley  drugs can make a person feel good    

this is piggybacking off another post about how little depth the klingons had in tng as compared to ds9  they were more complex in tos as well  in tng they re just savages who don t even fight that well  worf s primary good quality is he restrains his primal instincts  

they handle situations very much as a colonial power who s evolutionary superior to other peoples  i get that american exceptionalism nationalistic sort of reagan vibe from it  not to even hate on reagan too much  he famously did take in refugees as part of that exceptionalism  they did do things out of the grand benefaction of the empire  that was part of what gave them the moral high ground  the federation plays this game as well although they are fully earnest of course  it s odd because i remember tng as a communist kind of show because they don t have money and that is still true  it was still progressive for the 80s  but it seemed like more of a lateral step from tos than i was expecting  la forge is a great character but he seems more neutered as compared to nichelle nichols who was singing like an angel once per season and even gets to kiss the captain   that kiss wasn t great  kirk acted like he was miserable the whole time  but uhura canonically enjoyed it lol   tng is definitely more progressive with regards to feminism with the exception of them not letting troi wear underwear in that thing lol ",1644971032,startrek

finally caught up with s4 of discovery,"i finally got round to watching s4 and i think discovery has started to find it s stride 

 spoilers for s3 and s4 ahead   
s3 was mostly establishing the future and their place in it  and i think they carried this on well so far  but they re actually moving forwards rather than dwelling on the past  their s and the federation s  and the new  big bad  is interesting  feels like a proper star trek puzzle that s going to have an interesting and hopefully satisfying conclusion   i think that will be the big thing  as s2 and s3 had weak conclusions   

it also feels like we re finally starting to see and hear from more of the other senior staff and there s been at least a couple of occasions in this series where burnham hasn t had all the answers and even some good moral dilemmas  

then there s been some very solid episodes and ideas within it  the one with tilly and the cadets had some great character development moments for her and the others and had some lower decks kind of vibes with the crew  

the prison episode  the debate and the argument with burnham and booker was well done and it really felt like watching star trek  i think star trek generally does pretty well with these kind of prison episodes and this is no acception 

then the one with zora and the coordinates  was excellent   not as good as measure of a man by far   but a very interesting and different take on a similar concept

11  tyrellia  data mentions that 5 are serving on the enterprise in season 6  so presumably at least one of those were there 2 years prior  

 note that there are likely to be no bajorans counted here since this is before ro joins the crew   


so this only leaves only a few more species out of the hundreds of crew members we don t directly meet  surely there are some andorians  tellarites  and many more common federation species on the flagship  it s also being generous in assuming picard is talking about species homeworlds  and not including all the colonized planets that person could also be from  for example  beverly was born on luna  which could count separately as a colonized world

what does dilithium actually do  amp  how is it recycled  an analysis of dilithium in star trek ,"   before you begin 

  the best tldr i can do  this post explores what dilithium could have done as a  regulator  and as a power source  it also looks at how dilithium may have been recycled 
  this is technically part 2 of a 3 part series  but i have tried to make it a standalone  sorry for any inconsistencies   part 3  about black holes in a week or so 
  part 1  on antimatter   here  https   www reddit com r daystrominstitute comments pvcwxl analyzing_antimatter_how_it_could_be_produced    please read  u pfc9769  https   www reddit com u pfc9769   comments  amp  my reply to it   yes  i managed to procrastinate for 4 months  
  this post is accurate till dis s3  s4 not available in india   but from what i can indirectly see  there isn t any major information about dilithium in dis s4 
   someone please check my maths  amp  science too 

                                                                                                      

  regulator 

dilithium in m am reactions may have performed a similar function as graphite rods in nuclear power productions  graphite rods absorb or reduce the speed of neutrons produce during nuclear reactions  this in turn reduces the amount of neutrons with enough velocity to break down a radioactive atom to its daughter isotopes  amp  release energy  thus the amount of graphite can be varied to control the rate of reaction  they also act as safeguards against nuclear meltdowns or explosions by preventing chain reactions over a certain amount to continue 

but i said dilithium performs a  similar  function  not the same as graphite  this is because it doesn t need to control how much antimatter or matter reacts  we can do that  or how it reacts or how fast it does  reduces power production   it may however do something about the 200 000 hiroshima equivalents  data quoting 12 75 billion giga watts  being created every second in the reactor      8    

     warning  this is speculation   amp  personal incredulity  however well deserved       there is probably nothing that can survive 200 000 hiroshimas within a few ten s  to couple hundred meters  size of a warp core  at most   that much energy pretty much destroys anything as the temperatures produced are more than 10 000 kelvins  18 000 f  at the very minimum     9      also the energy produced in 10 seconds by the warp core is the lower end of the  total energy in a flare  https   en wikipedia org wiki solar_flare   which iirc managed to destroy a borg cube   tng  descent  pt 2  

that s where dilithium and it s link to subspace comes into play   dis  the citadel    i theorize there are 2 different roles dilithium might play  but it may as well be infinite until we get some concrete canon on this 

  it acts as a sort of transmitter  of energy  to subspace  dilithium sends a huge chunk of the energy created to subspace  this in itself doesn t create a warp field  aka subspace displacement field   that is done by the warp coils using warp electro plasma  warp plasma  here  is probably just relatively energy dense plasma  made from a tiny fraction of the energy from the m am reactions  the warp coils use the energy from the plasma to coalesce the energy in subspace  from the dilithium  to form an energy field that enables ftl   wait  i just created the perfect treknobabble  
  dilithium converts the energy from m am reactions into some sort of subspace energy  this at least has some basis in  canon  https   memory alpha fandom com wiki subspace_energy    this energy either creates some type of plasma  or is transferred to plasma  creating warp plasma  this plasma is transported via the eps system to the warp coils  which in turn generate the warp fields 

i personally like option 2 as it feels more realistic  amp  less treknobabble y  but any theory you create is just as valid  all i can say with  near  certainty is dilithium probably does something with subspace  amp  the insane amount of energy required for warp  and therefore is involved in any method that produces that much energy    including black holes  amp  m am reactions   

                                                                                                      

power source 

i could only find 3 sets of dialogues mentioning anything similar to dilithium power source  all tos 

 gt    engineering     
scott  i ve got bad news  captain  the entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused  no chance of repair   
   turbolift     
scott   oc    it s completely unusable   
kirk  no chance of restoring warp drive   
scott   oc    not without dilithium crystals  we can t even generate enough power to fire our weapons   
   tos  elaan of troyius   
 gt   
 gt  captain s log  stardate 3088 7          two of our dilithium crystals are missing  and without them the enterprise cannot operate at full power   
   tos  the alternative factor   
 gt   
 gt masters   a woman in a blue uniform  report on the dilithium crystals  captain   
kirk  yes   
masters  whatever that phenomenon was  it drained almost all of our crystals completely  it could mean trouble   
kirk  you have a talent for understatement  lieutenant  without full crystal power  our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours  re amplify immediately   
  tos  the alternative factor 

the first two quotes can be explained away easily as it could just mean they shouldn t can t get enough energy from matter antimatter reactions  this could be due to dilithium changing the energy into some other required type used by hose systems  or that the m am will produce too much uncontrolled energy  or something else 

however the 3rd quote seems to directly state that dilithium crystals have some sort of energy  and i can t fathom what can be  amplified      10      maybe dilithium is similar to superconductors in that it requires some external condition to function  or begin functioning   only that it needs to be  amplified  or replenished by something every once in while 

thus i   believe   that dilithium probably acted either as an energy storage than an actual energy source       almost pure speculation from this      if it is a battery  storage   it stores some of the energy created within the internal structure for later use  this was most likely the result of energy passing through it  being temporarily stored   amp  then released as required  the energy remaining after the previous usage would be used for the next startup  or for stuff that doesn t require considerable part of max power   thus if it were drained  process that relied on it  probably things like maintaining orbit  amp  weapons  would fail 

                                                                                                      

  recyclability 

dilithium is shown to recyclable reusable  while we never get an explanation for how it works  the names seems to suggest a few possibilities 

    dilithium incubators     st  runaway  dis  such sweet sorrow          crystal incubators exist in real life  kinda   so this  dilithium incubator  may do something similar to its function  from what i understand incubators  a smaller version of temperature controlled rooms  are able to grow able to   grow    protein  crystals or  crystallize proteins  https   en wikipedia org wiki protein_crystallization   dilithium incubators could perform a similar function by   growing   dilithium crystals  or at least crystallize some form of non crystalline dilithium      11  12    
    compositors     tng  family  relics  voy  innocence          the name says it all  they probably composite or combine drained or broken crystals to create new  usable crystals  these apparently have variants  such as the theta matrix compositor in tng      13    
    recrystallizers      dis  that hope is you  part 1   if it this does anything similar to real life recrystallization  it indicates that usage of dilithium crystals in a warp core leads to impurities being introduced in them  this also suggests that the introduction of these impurities is the cause of dilithium being  used up   and that the removal of them is enough for reusing the crystals      14    
    high energy photons      star trek iv   dilithium apparently can decrystallize  whatever that means   making it ineffective as a regulator  this dilithium can apparently be recrystallized using high energy photons that were released during nuclear fission   please read the footnotes for this      15  16

while not insane highly  this is still enough to  disassociate h2  http   people physics illinois edu ceperley papers 102 pdf   amp  melt pretty much anything  if we instead took the average solar density  1 4 g cc  for the plasma  the temperature of the plasma is about 112 kilokelvins 

    10     this amplification may help make the dilithium crystals a  phonon  https   en wikipedia org wiki phonon lattice_dynamics    amp  see  this  http   www2 ess ucla edu  schauble phonons html  too  of radiation light energy from power generation system  but this is pure speculation  amp  sounds an awful lot like a contradiction to me 

    11     note that i could only find these incubators being used for protein crystallization  so it may be that dilithium has some connection to proteins  or at least organic molecules  dilithium is said to be an element though  so this has a high chance of being wrong   this may explain its connection to biology  as seen in su kal 

    12     most of the references i got are literally from the market itself  including advertisements  so these may be biased  the only specifications on how it works  amp  what it even might be comes from a  website that sells it   https   www mitegen com product crystal growth incubators floor standing  

    13     this has no basis in reality though  the closest i could come to is  composite crystals  https   www jeol co jp en words emterms search_result html keyword composite 20crystal  

    14     this seems to be soft contradiction of canon on why dilithium becomes useless  so recrystallization in st may not mean what it means irl 

    15      if  high energy photons  can apparently make dilithium usable again  the lack of such processes in the 23rd century is    illogical  high energy photons  whatever high means  aren t unique to nuclear fission  and can probably be easily made now  let alone the 23rd century  this suggests that spock probably meant some other particle 

    16      this  again  suggests that some non crystalline form of dilithium exists  and dilithium can be converted between the two forms

humans seem to be the only species that use idioms in trek,"so  i was watching trek today  and i realized aliens never really use idioms much  it seems every few episodes you ll get the classic exchange of a human talking to an alien  spouting some random idiom  to which the alien responds with some variation of   excuse me  what the fuck   and then just chuckling and saying what they really mean  but you never really see this situation in reverse  aliens  do  invoke similes like the chatterers of maljar vi  but they at least have the good sense to avoid idioms like the plague  presumably because they realize that they just won t make any sense to anyone but them 

they also do this with handshakes as well   god knows how many times we ve seen an alien puzzlingly stare at an outstretched hand before conceding and grasping it  aliens  on the other hand  do not really tend to presume in this fashion  and only established ally species such as vulcans and klingons tend to have their greetings mirrored by humans 

in a way this lends a certain naivety or even brashness to humanity   while other species seem a lot more deliberate in the ways they communicate with aliens  we just kind of go around assuming other species can talk our talk and walk our walk  like an overconfident stranger in a strange land ",1644878183,startrek

i would say most of my feelings about enterprise 20 years on are much the same 

first 2 seasons i like but they were finding there feet 

season 3 was good  but season 4 it really found its feet with some of the best episodes in all trek 

i did notice quite glaringly the differences with how society was then and how it approached television compared to now  there were certainly some questionable episodes on how they portray women that felt closer to the original series than say modern day discovery  it is surprising as it does not feel that long ago 

trip had always annoyed me  and he did in the first 2 seasons as well on this watch  but he becomes far less annoying in season 3 and 4 

the opening music is still awful  but that said the visuals are probably the best of any of the star trek series opening credits  certainly the most interesting to look at

so all my molds were shot  the resin i used was old  but i still wanted to make some more practice pieces  here are the progress shots so ignore that most of these have bad shapes roughness etc   again bad molds  old resin  lots of rough work i ignored just so i could practice the paint method

i was only focusing on painting technique  and i really figured out what i was doing wrong before and what to do from now on  before i would spray too close  put too thick of a coat on and i would focus on certain spots of the badges with the spray paint can  i think really the only way i can get it to work is if i spray in very light coats multiple times  and i didn t have to wait too long between coats   i also had to spray farther away and never  ever focus on one spot of a badge  i did notice though if i sprayed too far away i d get orange peel  anyway misting is key  the sharpie black outline work is freehand  i can work on the others and fix them eventually ",1644844793,startrek

recycled plots ,"i was watching the voyager episode  one  the other day and i remembered the details differently than what was in the episode  it took me a while but i figured out why  it s essentially the same plot as enterprise s  doctor s orders   the ship has to cross a section of space that is toxic to all but one crewmember  the crew are put in stasis and the one remaining crewmember hallucinates  the details are a bit different but they are basically the same

ent   stratagem ,"i m rewatching   enterprise   and really enjoying the xindi arc  i remember recording this show on vhs from upn as a kid  now as an adult  i m getting a lot more out of it 

 stratagem  is one of my favorites  for a long while they let us believe we re watching another time skip like we saw in  twilight    earth was destroyed  the insectoids are winning a civil war with other xindi  and we re following the unlikely pair of archer and degra on the run  then  halfway through the episode  we learn that this is only a simulation within enterprise  meant to fool degra into divulging information 

the acting from bakula and degra actor randy oglesby was fantastic  despite the horrible things that degra did  oglesby manages to present a nuanced  conflicted character  the level of detail put into the simulator ruse made it believable   i think the whole writing and production team enjoyed creating this  play within a play   depending on how closely you re paying attention  the second ruse of the episode may surprise you as well as degra  the only thing i thought was missing was a discussion of the medical ethics of what phlox did to these xindi  archer might believe that this was more civilized than the airlock torture from  anomaly   but given phlox s absolute insistence on patient autonomy in  the breach   it s hard to believe he didn t have some qualms about wiping memories and implanting bloodworms 

the memory alpha  article  https   memory alpha fandom com wiki stratagem_ episode   really surprised me though  i had no idea that the concept of this story dates to the 40s 

  roald dahl published the short story   beware of the dog   https   en wikipedia org wiki beware_of_the_dog_ short_story   in 1944  in which an raf pilot is led to believe that he is recuperating in a british hospital  when in fact he has been captured by nazis 
  the short story inspired a 1965 flim called    36 hours  https   en wikipedia org wiki 36_hours_ 1965_film      here  a us army officer has been captured by nazis and is told that the war is over and that he is in a us hospital in occupied germany

i am writing a novel similar to star trek aand was hoping i can get help with an idea,"so i have two issues i am having trouble resolving

1  there was a dark matter anomaly enveloping the area of space my characters are in  obviously because discover is using the same thing i need to change that now  what an annoyign coincidence to be honest that just now discovery is using the same idea  but kind of funniy at the same time  anyway  does anyone have a good replacement idea instead of darkmater that is wrecking space  i can t use subspace because i think that is a term exclusive to star trek
2  also  as if i can t seem to ccatch a break  instead of warp drive  i created a power system called omicrom  which i thought sounded super cool  now obviously i cannot use omicron as it sounds like a disease  so i need a new name for my faster than light travel

star trek elimination game ,"hey guys 

 i ve seen this on a couple of other subreddits  notably r westwing and r scoobydoo  and i thought that star trek would be a good franchise to do it with  in other subreddits it has worked by having a list of all the characters and voting off each character one at a time until the most popular is found  obviously  due to the shear amount of characters in star trek that would be impossible so it would likely have to work in a staged format  like major sporting events e g  the football world cup works  

currently i ve got a list of 120 main characters from the whole franchise who i think would work  my main question is  is there interest for this sort of thing

at first  i did not care much for trip  i thought he was another basic kirk clone  like i thought riker was meant to be early on in tng  but he really grew on me  so much so that i would say that connor trinneer is in the top five best actors who played on a trek show  so his death on the finale really bothered me  not just because a good character died  but because there was no real reason for the show to kill him  what do the writers think they accomplished with this  what payoff was there  they really just made it so that the audience could not enjoy the finale   its supposed to be this feel good powerful moment where archer is about to give this big pre federation speech  and we don t feel good because one of the main characters just died  and they do not do his death justice at all  the crew does not grieve him and they seem really unbothered by it sitting in the audience in the hall 

  last episode aside  another thing that really bothered me is that the writers only serviced archer  trip  and phlox as heroes  t pol  hoshi  reed or travis never get to save the day  tng and ds9 did a great job making every main cast a hero  but the 4 non heroes of ent are only accessories to the other 3

concept for a civilian focused trek show,"so  a bit of a weird idea and something of a thought experiment  i ve been rewatching star trek picard with a friend who is a long term tng fan   this is his first exposure to pic  and we ve both been loving the experience  we ve just finished nepenthe  and it occurred to me that picard is the closest we ve got to a series focused on a  civilian  crew in trek  divorced from the usual focus on starfleet  even prodigy has the goal of emulating starfleet baked into its premise  

this got me wondering if an entire series could be focused on such a perspective  but without a heavy hitter like jean luc picard to anchor our  civvie  crew to the big picture  the idea stuck in my head and so i am blitzing out this pitch in a burst of energy to see what people think of it 
  
star trek  pioneers  
  
short pitch  if tos was  wagon train to the stars  and ds9 was  frontier post in space   then this is about living and settling the frontier  during a time of gradually renewed optimism  displaying a mix of used future and sleek tech  focused on putting the utopian ideals of trek under the microscope of everyday life 

our setting is post tng lower decks picard  while the synth ban has been lifted and the federation gradually recovering its high ideals  the galaxy is still reeling from the romulan supernova  but this also presents new opportunities  the collapse of the romulan star empire means that the former neutral zone has been opened up for settlement and exploration  but neither the federation or the romulan free state are willing to take a heavy hand in overseeing colonization efforts for fear of treading on the others  toes and inflaming old wounds  this has resulted in the environment we see in picard in the former neutral zone  a new frontier in space where law and order are malleable and often under the custodianship of paralegal groups such as the fenris rangers  

our core cast will be a starship crew  but none as we have seen before  the ss pioneer is a merchant vessel  but in her past life was an unimportant starfleet vessel  oberth or miranda class maybe  that was decommissioned and sold off into the civilian sector decades ago  she s an old lady who s been given a new name and a lease of life  her tried and tested spaceframe upgraded with whatever systems can be sourced and made to work  instead of a warp core  she has a second hand romulan singularity core  and her equipment and interior fittings are a cludge of repurposed gear purchased or bartered from any word or culture that can meet the required specs at an affordable price  hull space once intended for scientific research has been repurposed as passenger accommodations and cargo holds  and she can carry a maximum of fifty crew and two hundred passengers  though the usual crew complement is closer to twenty or thirty  

and  like classic merchant vessels from the golded age of sail  she runs heavily armed  for the galaxy can be a dangerous place  she doesn t have a dedicated security division  but the belligerent old master of arms makes sure that everyone aboard knows how to properly fire a phaser and operate in squad formation when defending the ship  and on the rare occasions when the pioneer gets into a scrap  oversees the ship s weapons and fire control from the bridge

the pioneer is one of a dozen or so ships owned by the towards dawn stellar navigation co  towards dawn itself is effectively a cooperative of small starship operators banded together for mutual support  combining their economic interests into a body that can punch above their individual level  ships within the towards stars fleet effectively operate as independent units  their captains  and a few primary stakeholders  making up a nominal  board of directors  who represent the interests of their crews  and who meet up weekly via holo conference to set company policy  barter jobs  review the figures  or trade gossip and banter over a few drinks  

ships within the company typically scout out work available in their area and either take a job or pass word back via the company to see if another towards dawn vessel wants it   on a very rare occasion the board members might delegate order a ship to take a particular job  but this is rare and typically quite democratic   there s no one individual owner who can force an issue or command the resignation firing of a captain 

shares in the company and its vessels are held primarily by crew members  relatives and outside investors  some larger concerns  but mostly small business owners  who benefit from the services towards dawn provides  the company outright owns some of its ships and leases rents others from their captains  who in theory can  buy back  their ship at any time  though the price will include not just the vessel s own value but the cost of any investment towards dawn has put into the ship 

towards dawn is thus the equivalent of an old west stagecoach company  and the pioneer and her running mates can be compared to seagoing tramp steamers  working to no set timetable and bound for wherever the work takes them  but with the benefit of a unified administration that can point direct coordinate their efforts  this week the pioneer might be transporting colonists from sector 001 into the former neutral zone  next week taking a contract to provide support services to a federation research asteroid  or transporting goods on behalf of a recently first contacted world or an independent ferengi trader  

they ll often be working solo  but sometimes pared with another ship of the line  or working in conjunction with ships of the fenris rangers  starfleet or romulan free state etc  towards dawn will take on lawful  more or less  work regardless of who the client is  and boasts that it can find or contract a ship for any task   pioneer is a good example of their average ship 

and there s plenty of work to be had in this uncertain era  and plenty of colourful individuals looking for work  pioneer s crew is a motley mix of lifelong  spacers  and  fresh meat   and though arranged in a shipboard hierarchy wherein the captain is god and the first mate their strong right hand  is going to be a lot more informal than what we d see on a starfleet vessel  

a good portion of the crew is from species that have only recently achieved warp flight  and who are using the opportunity of work aboard a starship to gain experience that will help themselves and their people grow as a spacefaring power  other crewmembers include starfleet reservists  former members of the romulan fleet  and anyone seeking to escape a checkered past or to make a name for themselves on the frontier  thus they re a heady  and sometimes volatile  mix of waifs and strays and runaways  but over time will become a shipboard family  with romance  heartbreak  friendship  betrayal  fond farewells and new arrivals  this also provides a chance to see classic trek races in new civilian sector capacities   i e  the ship s surgeon is a klingon who finds honour in the treating of wounds  and the quartermaster a bohemian ferengi who can put their hands on anything and who still values the aquisition of profit  but who sees that profit being in not in latinum but in a wealth of experiences and friends 

the bodged together nature of the ship and her crew is thus very much in the tradition of trek  being about overcoming differences while celebrating individual uniqueness and working together to form a whole  through their eyes we ll also get a look into day to day civilian life both out in space and planetside  a perspective often missed in high flying trek 

our captain is a former member of the romulan elite  fallen on hard times  once the captain of a valdore type warbird  she acquired the pioneer after the supernova and spent most of her remaining assets to do so  the ship is not just her command  but her home  and we first meet her in the process of  selling leasing  the ship s deed to towards dawn  a necessity brought about by being unable to keep up pioneer s operating costs on her own  while also being unwilling to leave a ship that has become her home of over a decade  her safe anchorage during trying times  she is now benefitting from being part of a larger enterprise that can provide funds to properly maintain and crew the ship  still but chafes somewhat at going from being the absolute master of her destiny to an owner employee in a larger co operative  she ll come around in time  but her overall arc will examine  among other things  finding a balance between individual liberty freedom and collective responsibility to a greater community society crew 

the new first mate put aboard the pioneer by towards dawn would ideally be an ironic counterpoint to the captain   perhaps a former enemy like a decommissioned starfleet officer  or a reman  a race previously looked down upon by romulans  either way  the new first mate quickly becomes an essential figure in the captain s life  both as her subordinate and as a friend 

and so with the pioneer now fully paid up  crewed and made ready for sea  she casts off into the final frontier  no doubt bound for many adventures  they won t be saving the galaxy but will be fighting for their living and sticking up for the smaller voices in a very big universe  and maybe getting involved in the fringes of the  bigger picture  along the way 

 

like i said  just a thought experiment  but i think a pretty compelling one for a trek series that goes in a different direction and gives us a different viewpoint  while still taking us on episodic adventures to worlds both familiar and unknown  following a small crew facing down the wonders and oddities of the galaxy and trying to make a living in the heart of it all

just watched voyager for the first time and loved the ending,"  spoilers if you haven t seen it  

i ve seen a lot of one off comments over the years of endgame and how it was disappointing so i was prepared to be let down but i really like it and here s why 

it was clever how the glimpse we got of the crew back home was in the beginning of the episode and not the end  then the momentum carried to the very last scene 

future janeway being more cynical makes sense    that happens to people as they age when they ve accumulated some heavy life events  and then her arc was rediscovering her old self who wasn t like that  and i like that it actually tied to drinking coffee which up until that point was more of a a lighthearted thing 

current janeway s arc was incredible too  she would rather save lives by destroying the borg array than take the easy way out 

future kim is a captain and finally not an ensign anymore and present kim gives that incredible speech about  the journey  rather than the destination 

paris and torres finally have the baby  neelix gets a nod and they follow up on seven s crush on chakotay 

the doctor steals every scene he s in like always 

and i like the fact that it s a crazy ride that just ends  it would have been anticlimactic or rushes to suddenly have a reunion montage    we got to see the journey  not the destination   ",1644729126,startrek

 short scene flash fiction  a klingon doctor,"the klingon struggled against the restraints that held him to the bed  letting out a few curses in his native language  ending with a stern  you should have let me die  

the doctor paid no attention to the patient s outrage 

 what glory  what honor  is there in this   the patient yelled again  pulling at the chains with the strength of decades of combat 

the doctor finally turned around to address her patient    glory  honor   she finally responded    when i publish my results  more people in the galaxy will know my name then know yours  general   when a warrior like you is victorious in battle  they sing songs about you   when a doctor like me wins  people want to talk to us   you are invited to drink   i am invited to teach   i challenge you  general  which is the greater honor  

 it is a disgrace to die like this   let me die in battle   like a warrior   not like some experiment  

 i am a healer  general   i do not intend to let you die at all   a klingon does not surrender anything to the enemy  

the general seethed in silent rage for a time  before the doctor interrupted him    tell me  general  in your greatest triumph  how many did you kill in battle  

the general answered in a moment    427   a group of romulans were trying to invade an outpost   they were no match for klingon weapons and klingon will    he jerked the chain  trying to bring his to his chest    qa plah  

 427  using a ship that you did not build  using weapons you did not make   you only pulled a trigger  yet you claim all of the glory as yours  

if looks could kill  the doctor would have died in that instant 

 and i have gone to battle with millions  using a weapon that i have created   this enemy  like yours  invaded klingon territory and tried to take it for its own  

 hah  millions  doctor  millions  even for a klingon you exaggerate too much  

the doctor just pressed a button when a computerized voice announced    eight hundred  thirty seven million  nine hundred seventy six thought  four hundred twelve compromised cells found

ds9 podcast youtube channel  the 7th rule  hosted by cirroc loften  jake sisko ,"i see a lot of buzz and discussion around the delta flyers podcast but never hear anything about the 7th rule so i thought i d raise awareness 

the 7th rule was a podcast youtube channel started by aaron eisenberg  nog   cirroc loften  jake sisko  and ryan t husk  their friend  and they do weekly reviews of every episode of ds9 they are currently on season 6  tragically aaron passed away fairly early on in this channels life  around season 2  but ryan and cirroc decided to continue the podcast and honour aaron s legacy 

the show frequently have actors from star trek appear on it for both interviews as well as episode discussions  for instance they had nana visitor on the show while discussing duet and andrew robinson on the show when discussing the wire  they also feature writers and directors for episodes in their discussions as well 

it doesn t just end there though they also review nu trek as well  with discovery  picard and prodigy reviews and discussions the week they air 

the usual upload style is they ll upload a shortened version of their ds9 discussions to youtube  20 30 mins  while having the full discussion on their patreon and after 3 4 weeks they uploaf the full discussion to their youtube  their most recent full review being the magnificent ferrengi 

it s honestly a fantastic channell that i m surprised isn t heard of or talked about more

why i don t enjoy binge watching tos  too much of a product of its time ,"let me preface this   i love star trek  i love the original series  and i love all of the actors that come from it   star trek was and is a visionary masterpiece of sci fi and nothing will ever take away how progressive and instrumental it was to the cultural zeitgeist   

that being said  i don t know whether its the fact that it s campy 60s television  with all of the design and social quirks that come with it  but i just can t binge and enjoy it like i can other series   i can take it in small doses  maybe one or two episodes at a time  but after its game over   

to me  the weird flowy uniforms  especially the gold trim on kirk s shirts  how everything looks really plasticky  and how the future seems so strange   i get that that kind of retro futuristic idealism is both a product of its time and roddenberry s original utopian visions of how the star trek universe should be  but to me it is just too far removed from things to feel like it could be the future of the earth   enterprise  surprisingly  suffers from this the least   say what you want about the series as a whole  but the fact that things seemed realistic  that people  remembered  what life was like before utopia  things with like home cooking and going out in the grass were common pastimes  not relics of the past   i m currently watching the past tense episodes of ds9  and this is the connection that i find modern star trek handles well  connecting the utopian view of the future as a hard fought gift that brought us from the past  not just the status quo   in interviews  actors and those close to roddenberry said that his vision of star trek was that all of these problems had been solved already   but as enterprise  ds9  the original series cast movies  and even some parts of tng  with its 80s 90s beige enterprise which i despise  still made things seem realistic   tos stands as a neat image of the future  but not a realistic one  which makes it to me like impressionist paintings  colorful and pretty  but headache inducing to stare at for long periods of time ",1644703763,startrek

star trek  the original series production order episode 6   the naked time,"hey 
these are my thoughts on the naked time in my tos re watch 
this episode showcases part of why my favorite characters are my favorite characters 
first off  sulu 
if this was any other show at this time  sulu would have had a katana instead of a fencing foil 
i believe john df black actually gave george takei the choice of using or not using a katana 
seeing sulu go crazy with the fencing foil is a reminder that  while sulu may not have that much depth to him  this little detail shows that sulu is a character that represents asian people without being a stereotype  which would have been near unheard of in 1966 
also  it would have been awesome if george went onto play a campy swashbuckler character 
so much potential 
moving onto spock 
intoxicated though he may have been at the time  this is the first time we start to see some of the real spock 
also  it would have been rare for a male character to cry in a show from 1966 
the way he keeps stammering about his duty actually reminds me of my own thought process 
  i don t care about my duty  i don t care about what i have to do  i just want to be me   
this is what spock would have been thinking and i have thought along those same lines myself 
i m autistic 
since i m autistic  i have to blend in with my neurotypical  or nt  counterparts by downplaying my autistic qualities which is quite exhausting 
obviously  spock isn t on the spectrum but there s a lot of overlap between having to downplay these autistic qualities of mine and spock having to hide his emotions from his vulcan peers ",1644689477,startrek

star trek needs less logic and more crying   a take that forgets pre disco trek,"i just read this article on polygon 

 https   www polygon com platform amp 22924014 star trek discovery character emotions  https   www polygon com platform amp 22924014 star trek discovery character emotions 

i haven t hidden my distaste for discovery and picard  but i also like to try and keep an open mind  and understand what i might be missing  this article however makes some pretty strong claims that at least to me don t seem to hold up if you re familiar with original star trek or if you disagree with any of the philosophy underlying the points 

first i strongly disagree with the premise that we should be emotional over logical as a guiding principle  today s world seems to be that world where emotions and gut feelings override facts and logic in many parts of public life  is the current world  the best world  the polygon writer can imagine  the one we should hold up for emulation  well  job done then  and why bother with speculative fiction   

second the idea that there was no emotion guiding characters in trek before discovery or something    they mention city on the edge of forever  did they think it would have been a better outcome if they listened to their emotions in the moment and saved keeler  even emotionally the alternative seemed devastating if you go 5 minutes on and realize you just lost your world and friends etc  

and they seem to completely miss the non logical  arguably emotional actions of kirk in the apple or space seed  kirk didn t have a logical reason to break the society of the apple  and certainly not an emotional basis to say to kahn   i respect you even though you re a horrible person who tried to take over the ship  so i will go super easy on you and just exile you to a planet rather than take you to jail 

it s not even that og trek pushed logic over emotion   clearly tos was about the balance between spock as logic and mccoy as emotion  this seems like yet another person who read the cliff notes of star trek before disco and basically makes stuff up  i don t even know where the polygon writer got the  popular conception  that star trek was about logic over emotion 

and furthermore   even if you buy that a product of the times needs to be focused on people s emotions   disco and pic never  deal with them   no one is in therapy  no one seems to consider how to deal with conflicting emotions from different characters  in fact  in disco s2  the burnham and tyler emotional  issues  were dealt with by trying to suppress them iirc   and as far as exploration of emotions impacting life   disco seems to top out at  let s cry   

the dismissal of philosophy  as slap dash as it might have been as  fundamentally a logical argument  with regard to the measure of a man also seems misguided  they feel that an episode i haven t seen     but to connect is a better or more modern take on the same theme   because it s based on empathy  the issue is   this point of view imo is how we get biased outcomes that we re trying to deal with in the us today  if you define who is a person based on how you feel empathy for them   this is how we ended up with so much discrimination today  this method would lead to  devil in the dark  re affirming the miners point of view because they  don t  feel like the horta is a person  of course the other issue is they don t mention if anyone on the show  felt  the opposite of staments  nor how one ought to resolve such conflicting feelings  

 the goal of the debate isn t to comb through legal proceedings  but to allow the participants to have their feelings recognized and validated   

this is all somewhat interesting   but seems to lead to no resolution   once we ve recognized people s feelings  must we validate them always  sometimes people feel things that aren t valid in the situation  and even if the feelings are validated   this doesn t resolve a debate   very rarely in fiction or the real world are circumstances that lead to a debate that no one has figured out how they feel outside of rom com s maybe  

let s take the klingon war in s1 of discovery   even if the federation had recognized and validated the klingon s feelings that the klingons wanted glory  war  and to crush the federation as a way to unite the empire   and the klingons took on board the federation wanted to be friends   what does that do for the situation  if the klingons want to use the federation as a way to unite the empire  to feel strong and impactful again as a galatic power   they don t care that the federation doesn t want a war  and their cultural feelings won t be satisfied without that war  discovery contradicts itself i guess ",1644678124,startrek

riker s ptsd,"the idea popped up in  the best of both worlds  that riker was afraid of the captain s chair and that is why he had turned down three commands  the aries in  the icaris factor   the melbourne in  the best of both worlds  and in  the arsenal of freedom  he says that he turned down a command to serve on the enterprise as first officer    i think he knew he wasn t ready for command and took the position of first officer to learn under a different captain how to command before accepting his own command  not wanting to just be a captain  but wanting to be the best captain possible 

until picard was assimilated by the borg and riker was field promoted to captain   while in command of the enterprise  the first thing he did was order worf to fire on the borg cube with their new weapon in an attempt to destroy that ship   riker later tells guinan that he tried to kill picard  something that guinan shoots down  no  you tried to kill whatever they turned him into    

until the events of  the best of both worlds   riker is presented as a competent officer and commander   while yes  the events of  the samaritan snare  doesn t paint him in the best light  and honestly  no one looks good in that episode   riker  before that  is able to reconnect the enterprise in  encounter at farpoint   gets infected but doesn t sub come to the illness in  the naked now   knows that kozinski is full of shit in  where no one has gone before   holds in own on a klingon bird of prey in  a matter of honor   is a decent opponent to picard in  peak performance    and is able to command the enterprise in  captain s holiday  without incident 

after the destruction of the borg cube and picard s return from assimilation  shelby tells riker that soon he will be offered another command  but we don t see it happen for over 10 years until he takes command of the titan   why   what if the events of  the best of both worlds  rattled him or scarred him into not wanting to take command   or what if those events made him a worse officer   could he have been suffering from ptsd and no one has ever really mentioned it 

when he takes the captain s chair next  it is in the episode  final mission  where he is struggling to deal with a garbage pod   he is the reason why the enterprise almost falls into enemy hands in  the game    he takes command in  rascals  only to lose the ship to ferengi   comparing riker in the first three seasons of tng  against the last 4 seasons  we see a weaker riker  an officer who s not as good as he once was 

this is why in the events of  chain of command   riker is passed over for captain  in favor of captain jellico   jellico is quick to point out that riker really isn t captain material and it isn t long until captain jellico relieves him of duty   riker isn t the same top quality officer he was before his encounter with the borg   having to give the order to kill picard affected him   having to command the enterprise during a combat situation and giving the order to ram the enterprise into the borg cube  seeing the ship graveyard at wolf 359 and seeing the ship that he was offered to command  the melbourne  adrift in the wreckage  got to him   

this may also be why he is in command of the titan  a small ship that only has to worry about pakleds and not much else   he doesn t have to worry about going through what picard did   the pakleds aren t going to assimilate him   

worse is that riker s ptsd went unnoticed   troi was concerned about picard s recovery  and then there is barcley to deal with   later she had to focus on geordi s therapy after his time being programmed by the romulans   all anyone noticed was riker s drop in job  performance  leading starfleet to not offer him a command ",1644653056,startrek
it s still insane to me that we are getting a new star trek episode  a week  every week  for the next two years minimum ,"think about that for a moment 

remember  if you were old enough  when enterprise ended and there was a thought we may not get a show for a few years  if not decades as some were predicting back then   when the first kelvin movie was announced  it was definitely great  a big budget star trek film with all the bells and whistles  even if you weren t sold on it all  it was definitely an exciting time to see star trek reemerge again  but it still wasn t the same as having a tv show  at least not to me 

and we got 3 films in a 7 year period which amounted to about just 6 and a half hours of content   ugh  and we re still waiting for the  next  one nearly six years on   double ugh  

for fans  beggers can t be choosers but i missed just having one star trek show on and at least 6 months worth of stories every year  when we got two shows  tng and ds9 and then ds9 and voy  it was great  i never complained  it was nuts knowing two shows were on the air together for 7 years straight 

so when discovery was announced  it felt good  really good  i did suspect we would get another show after that one  but i was thinking five years down the line  once picard was announced  right after the first season of discovery  that s when things started to feel different and that star trek was finally coming back in a big way  

and now  we will have officially 5 shows this year once snw starts  and there is just so much freaking star trek coming our way  it s insane  even right now  when you just add up the stuff we know coming this year along with all the shows recently renewed for future seasons  if everything goes as planned  you know how many episodes that will be 

  105 episodes   

that s coming just in the next two years  it really feels like the 90s again but bigger since those shows still took tons of breaks and didn t air all year  these shows are guaranteed to give us a new episode every single week through february of 2024  even if you don t like all of the shows  chances are you like some of them  so everyone will have something to look forward to  and if things go the way i m sure viacom and fans hope  we could have a new weekly episode for 5  years on 

for me  i can t ask for anything more    except maybe another show   d",1644651048,startrek

in star trek ii  the wrath of khan  i always wondered where the bit of damaged jet pack looking thing on the wall came from  today i finally figured it out ,"here it is  https   i imgur com t12zfc4 jpg

when chekhov and terrell are exploring the remains of the cargo containers from the botany bay  there is a bit of something hanging on the wall  a bit of framework with some tanks on it  literally since i first saw this film in the 1980 s i have wondered where it came from  it obviously looked like a prop from an older movie  just some junk they found in the back of the studio warehouse  a few weeks ago i actually spent some time googling it  and couldn t find any information  and now that i ve posted it here  i suspect someone else will find it with a ten second google search  but anyway  

lately i ve been on an old cheesy sci fi movie kick  i watched one on youtube and it s been recommending others to me ever since  today it recommended  destination space   a 1959 pilot for a tv series that the network never purchased  right at the beginning  you can see the same prop appear on screen  in its original form 

i couldn t be more pleased  just such a random thing i ve been wondering about for literally decades  and i recognized it immediately when it showed on screen  i just wanted to share it with others  thinking maybe there are others like me who have not seen it 

for context  some youtube links    here is a scene where you can see the prop behind khan  https   www youtube com watch v oofmj6cwzlm amp t 35s   and  here is the link to the  destination space  pilot   https   www youtube com watch v q_duxw0bdmq ",1644646545,startrek
did picard violate the prime directive ,"so my girlfriend and i just got done watching the star trek tng episode identity crisis  the one with the aliens that show up under a black light and reproduce by a parasite that transforms the host  

at the end of the episode  once commander leighton and geordie are saved  picard issues the order to place warning beacons around the planet to warn others not to approach 

wouldn t that be violating the prime directive then  to prevent a species from performing their natural reproduction cycle  if the species is unable to reproduce  then would the species not die out as a direct result of the federation s actions

sure there s an offhand mention that he was told he couldn t resign his commission because of the court  but the simple existence of said commission means he s already being treated as a sentient being and not a piece of equipment  yet at no point does anyone even ask maddox the question of   if he is just a piece of equipment  why does he have a commission

even hollower pursuits,"i ve just learned from reading several synopses of  hollow pursuits   tng  that my understanding of what happened at the end of the episode is quite unconventional  but i can t find any evidence inside the episode that i m wrong  so i m wondering if anybody else saw it the same way 

the  normal  interpretation of the final scene is that after the real crew found out about barclay s holodeck versions of them  barclay went back into the holodeck to say goodbye to his fantasy crew  said  end program   and walked back into the hallway of the real enterprise 

my interpretation of the final scene is that the entire episode except for the hallway at the end had been in the holodeck  a program barclay had designed to play out his humiliation kink fantasy  having humiliation fantasies seemed to fit with his character  the scenes with the crew as musketeers   a goddess   etc  had been a holodeck in a holodeck  similar to riker s scenes with the future enterprise crew in  future imperfect    and the scenes where the crew discovered barclay s fantasies about him  humiliating him  were also still in the holodeck  then  at the end of the episode  barclay resigned on the bridge of that holodeck crew  the one that had caught him in his fantasies  then he said  computer  end program  and walked out into the hallway of the real enterprise  i assumed that the  holodeck in a holodeck  reveal was a twist ending  and that s why the entire episode was about barclay s fantasy life  his  hollow pursuits  

the way i understood the episode certainly makes it a more avant garde episode  but i don t think it s any weirder than  future imperfect   so i can t quite convince myself i m wrong ",1644609592,startrek

  it is filled to the brim with passionate trekkies who did very well in their roles  side characters can get additional voice actors   something they did with the legend of vox machina 

  it gives paramount   more ready made star trek material since the campaigns are done  all that is left is to animate them to bring the tales to life  the fact that the production will be animated can help the live action shows continue to work as this production is on screen   no dead time and more trek on the streaming system 

  it occupies a unique type of animated show for kurtzman era star trek   one that is less childish than prodigy and more serious than lower decks  both campaigns are more in line with the classic berman era shows  so more space adventure overall  

  the productions already have ties to existing star trek products  most notably the mmo star trek online and the officially licensed star trek adventures rpg book  the tie ins will further increase profit for a multitude of star trek products

star trek  discovery knows trek needs less logic and more crying   a well written article and one that entirely misses the point," https   www polygon com 22924014 star trek discovery character emotions  https   www polygon com 22924014 star trek discovery character emotions 

this is a nicely written article  the author references many different scenes from all the different trek series  and yet entirely misses the main point i think 

i have more or less enjoyed every trek series that has come out  i know the main character names in every series  discovery is the first series where i don t remember all the names because to me  there s not much difference between the characters  at this point i watch it partly out of hope it will become star trek  and partly just to get it out of the way so i can watch something else 

before i go any further  let me just say that if you enjoy discovery  that s totally fine  i m not offended by someone else enjoying something i don t particularly like  i m not trying to attack anyone who likes it  but i do wish the show would become better more interesting  at least in how i define better more interesting 

the problem for me  and i have a feeling for a lot of discovery s detractors  isn t that it has feelings  it s that it only has feelings  the author in the article is making the argument that we need feelings to save the day instead of logic  and yes  having some passion about things can definitely lead to heroic moments  but you need logic behind that 

 some mild spoilers ahead 

case in point   when they are discussing what to do about the ships computer  in the end they decide to destroy the kill switch on the computer  to me that makes no sense  at all  they have effectively given an alien creature that they barely know complete and total control over the ship  and all the lives of every person on the ship  they decide to make her a member of starfleet just by asking   no testing or anything that every other member of starfleet has to go through  no kobayashi maru test for her  we will just go on our positive feelings that the computer won t have some sort of meltdown when faced with an impossible scenario  and realistically speaking  every crewmember on that ship has a kill button   you can pull out a phaser and shoot them  the computer is the only one who is untouchable now 

another example of feelings running rampant to me was the episode where they were stuck in that void  all of the major characters all had to go on about their childhoods  all in different scenes  

any one of those scenes individually would have been fine  but all of the characters spontaneously have to have discussions about their childhood emotions  not to mention that basically nothing happens at all in that episode that has any bearing at all on the plot  the only thing of any consequence that happens is the computer is finally acknowledged as being aware alive   by having a story about overcoming childhood emotions 

i like pizza  i really really like pizza  but even i don t want to eat pizza and only pizza  discovery is like a diet of just eating pizza  all of the characters all have emotional issues to work through  and that s all we really ever see  any of that in moderation would be good  but all of that all of the time just makes me tired of it  the only reason i am watching discovery at this point is because it has the star trek label on it  if not for that  i d probably stop watching even in mid season  and even it being part of star trek is starting to get close to not being reason enough to keep watching 

honestly  i think they should take the crew of discovery and put them in an entirely different plot  they don t belong on a starship  at the end of the day starfleet is a job  one with military undertones  in no universe can i imagine the crew of any ship acting the way the characters on discovery act ",1644598095,startrek

      tarka claims the scanners      couldn t pick out a betazoid standing alone in a nieser cage    and as betazoids are telepathic we can assume the function of the scanners is still sniffing out telepaths  who or what a nieser  and why you would want one to be caged  or maybe a cage made of it   is unclear 

  the  karma barge  is hidden by a hologram of some sort of sea serpent  in  if memory serves  the talosians used an illusion of a black hole to warn interlopers off from their world 

  haz is the sort of person who always has a saying for every situation  and though a lot of those sayings border on indecipherable  he does mention some familiar references 

        i heard we had starfleet guests so i just had to scurry like a spider cow to welcome you    boimler and mariner did have a close encounter with a large spider creature that farmers were using to milk in  second contact   whether or not haz intended to just gum on the starfleets before he recognized burnham isn t made explicit but i think we can assume that to be the case 

        i have missed you like a cardassian misses cake    we re all familiar with cardassians of course  but i don t remember an particular reference that would indicate they like  em thicc 

        it s true what the elasians say  give a man a tor bak and you are warm in the desert    the elasians are from  elan of troyius  

        what in the katterpod and calaman sherry is going on here    a katterpod is a type of bajoran mushroom with a variety of food uses mentioned several times over the course of ds9  and data ordered a calaman sherry while on a date in  in theory   how are they related  only haz and the smiling koala know 

        while you two were strutting around like klingons in a disco     of course we haven t seen any klingons in disco since the season three finale 

        act like an armus     the villain of  skin of evil  who murdered tasha yar for no other reason than that he could 

    uhm  hugh  the ship cleans for us    stamets points out  echoing a fact established by  riker in  up the long ladder   personally i was not expecting doctor culber to snap back   well good for the bloody ship   or the foot bath that followed 

  burnham cuts a promo declaring owosekun as   the most ferocious fighter this side of felton prime    referencing a planet where general martok executed a successful sneak attack against a cardassian base during the dominion war  as recounted in  once more unto the breach  

  booker and tarka are able to uncover that the cheater who s been plaguing haz is actually a changeling 

  the species we see the changeling imitate while it moves throughout the  karma barge  are 

      xindi insectoid

      a yet unnamed species we ve seen before this season

      human

      tribble

      the humanoid form changelings assume when dealing solids

  tarka repurposed the devore scanner to emit a forcefield to trap the changeling cheat  in  a fistful of datas  worf was able to jury rig a personal forcefield out of his combadge 

  haz decides that burnham  book  and two emerald chain goons who want the isolynium should all play poker to see who gets it  this is the first time poker s been mentioned on  discovery   but it s an especially popular game across trek  bones once offered to teach it to spock in  the corbanite maneuver   jake sisko did teach the game to nog  as mentioned in  progress   chakotay  paris  kim and neelix had a game interrupted by the arrival of a borg cube in  collective   hoshi revealed to trip that she once broke a co s arm over a dispute that arose from a game  and the senior staff of the  uss cerritos  has a regular game  but they re all terrible  as seen in  moist vessel 

  haz s backroom has a number of weapons on the wall  including a  discovery  style klingon mek leth  last seen season two s  point of light  

  haz s cards have some familiar faces painted on them 

      queen of spades   the unnamed species with a cranial shell from the party at the end of  beyond 

      queen of diamonds   arcadian

      king of diamonds   cardassian

  burnham guesses correctly that species 10 c might be using the dma to harvest boronite  an element that according to  the omega directive  the borg used to synthesize a single omega molecule  which on its own would have contained the same amount of energy as a 24th century warp core ",1644578664,startrek

why is neelix ,"like seriously why  he s got to be one of the worst conceived sci fi characters i ve ever seen   gives jar jar binks a run for his money  at least lucas had the sense to mostly phase him out after the first movie  we get stuck with neelix for seven damn seasons  and he s such a space karen   will not shut the fuck up  they play it for jokes  but it s just annoying  

quark   now that s how you do comic relief  his appearance in the pilot was a sad reminder of what we would be missing out on in voyager  

plus  nobody likes to see the biggest dork on the ship hook up with one of the hottest crew members   not even trekkies  that whole relationship was paternalistic and creepy  

i m pretty new to voyager  and only seen one episode where neelix comes across as sympathetic  overall i still dig the show  but please tell me it gets better  ",1644567422,startrek
did they mess up the pips on geordi in relics ,there s a scene where geordi is having a discussion with scotty in engineering  i think  might have been when the two of them were in the other ship   anyway it appears that they put a single whole pip on the left and two hollow pips on the right on his collar   i couldn t find anything  image or text to explain the goof  but i thought it was interesting ,1644564522,startrek

startrek s ranks system seems to make no sence ,"so it seems that the rank and comand system seem to make little to no sence  

in one episode of one show you have ensigns who are treated like an ensign should and then next thing you have ensigns as senior staff   

not to mention the whole nightshift nothing happens so jr officers can comand   it s space things have equal chance of happening at any time  

like if i were to write a sci fi story about an organization like startrek   i would have a captain   xo  shift commanders for each shift   department lead and a shift lead for each department for each shift   

department heads would be lt commanders 
shift leads full lt 
shift commanders should commanders
xo probably add a new rank of sr commander or jr captain  
and captain   it creates a much more organized comand structure   

1 captain 
1 xo
3 4 commanders  depending on shift rotation 
science  medical  security  tactical  engineering  each get a department lead   and 3 4 shift leads  
if you can have a shift that the xo and the department heads run cutting down the number a bit   you can also  combine security and tactical if you like  

so assuming you do use the xo and department heads to cut down the numbers a little  we can get down to 

1 captain 
1xo
2 3 commanders
4 department heads 
and 8 12 shift leads  

but that gives us a sr staff of 6 and then each department has its own sr officers of 3 or 4   now give each shift lead a specialization if you like   not going to get into that

the flagship,"been giving this some thought

archer s enterprise is the first warp 5 ship in starfleet  is it the flagship

kirk s enterprise is the flagship in it s time 

 amp  x200b 

picard s enterprise is the flagship in it s time 

 amp  x200b 

enterprise e is the flagship for about the second half of voyager 

 amp  x200b 

discovery in pike s time  was no the flagship  it may hae possibly still been the enterprise 

 amp  x200b 

insofar as we know  ent e is still flying in lower decks  is it the flagship  still 

 amp  x200b 

we haven t seen a sign of a flagship in picard s first season   zheng he  maybe

discovery is the most prominent ship in discovery s future time  but i feel like voyager is the flagship of the fleet by that time ",1644550670,startrek

did the el aurans know about the nexus as a species or did the survivors just randomly encounter it   spoilers ,"rewatching generations for the first time in years i always had a theory but now not so sure  i always assumed the nexus was a secret of the el aurans  somehow they had a way on their planet to enter it safely  and after the borg destroyed their world they lost that access  with how guinan explains it  names it  knows sorens motivation  and how none of the other survivors wanted to be rescued by the enterprise b  it didn t seem random  the survivors forced the transports to fly into the ribbon to go back because after the loss of their world that was the only way to escape that reality  go back to a time before the borg  how soren knew he could get back in by being on a high enough point to be  pulled  inside  i figured on their homeworld the ribbon similarly came close enough to get inside  he just had to recreate that on another planet  not that it took soren 70  years to figure out how to return  but that the ribbon only travelled through the galaxy once every 70 years and it was something the el aurans waited and planned for 

but now  im thinking maybe they just randomly encountered it  if time has no meaning inside  maybe guinan  soren  and the rest learned about the nexus enough even though it only seemed like minutes in our reality 

i guess it adds to the mystery of the el aurans if it was something they knew about  if it was just random it almost just seems dumb or at least not special 

did anyone else have any theory or thoughts or anything  i d be curious to hear from other fans ",1644548355,startrek

  they ve been made illegal and vanished  assumed gone entirely by some 
  they ve reappeared
  in the ancient past a synthetic race wiped out its creators
  they are now incredibly powerful and hiding outside the galaxy
  they are waiting to be summoned by a new synthetic race
  the recent synthetic race are attempting to contact the ancient synthetic race
  if they succeed they will wipe out organic life in the galaxy

i have finally watched ds9 from start to finish,"ds9 was around when i was in my 20 s  i loved tos and tng but for some reason i never got into ds9  i had only seen an episode here and there but never took the time to watch it all 

so a few months ago i decided to watch the entire series from start to finish  because i had heard it s widely considered the best trek series among a lot of fans  i was not disappointed 

i can t help but admire how they had an overall story arc already planned out from the start  it was a very long and comprehensive narrative and yet many of the episodes also work as standalone pieces  as someone who once wanted to be a writer  i m in awe of their ability to tell such a complex long form story 

the cast is stellar  i felt sisko and some of the others sometimes chewed their scenes a bit but it was never to the point where it ruined things for me  i m not sure if i can pinpoint who my favorite actor was from a sheer performance standpoint  rene auberjonois was superb as odo  soulful yet distant  exuding utmost competence but yet holding a fathomless loneliness within  he was a man of many burdens  and he carried them with stoic grace 

nana visitor also stands out  the conflicted former terrorist that struggles with her role as part of the new government  she endures  so  much but it never breaks her  she weathers the tempest  still standing tall after it s over  she s emotionally the strongest character in the show imo  never flinching from the truth no matter how much it hurts her 

thematically it s a very unique story  daring to show a shady side of starfleet in shocking ways at times  even to where they attempt genocide  the show doesn t hesitate to undermine authority  and to state that sometimes it s necessary to use violence to counter fascism  the show doesn t hesitate to call out imperialism and colonialism  and in a lot of ways the cardassians represent america far more than the federation does  it s pretty daring stuff and way ahead of its time imo 

there were so many fantastic character arcs  from major characters like worf to minor characters like damar  i mean damar started off as gul dukat s lickspittle  his smithers  and yet by the end emerges as such an epic legend 

the humor was often driven by the ferengi characters  and the actors who played quark  rom  and nog were perfectly casted and up to the task  of course i couldn t entirely avoid spoilers on a show that had been around for so long  and i had known that rom was going to become grand nagus  but still it didn t ruin the experience for me 

and then for them to cap off the show with what was basically a 10 part story  it was brilliant and some of the best episodes i ve ever seen  in  any  show  tacking into the wind was probably my favorite aside from the finale itself  it was glorious 

i have to agree with fans that say it was the best series  it doesn t even come close  tng may have some of the best individual episodes of all time  but overall you just can t beat ds9 in my book ",1644510488,startrek

how did you get into trek  what series was your entry point ,"for me  it was star trek  the voyage home   i was 16 at the time it came out in the theaters   i knew about trek  and had seen an episode or two  but was not impressed  i think i saw some bad season 3 ones    then a new friend i had made who was a trekkie asked if i wanted to see the movie   

it was a friday night 10pm showing and my curfew was at 11pm   my mother would not let me stay out later and i got annoyed at that since i had not broken any of her rules and never showed an ounce of rebellion   but i told my friend she was fine with it and at 9pm i snuck out of my room and went to the movies 

met some great people on line as we waited for the doors to open   they explained what had happened in the previous 2 movies   gave me a list of the best trek episodes i should rent from the video store   

when the movie was over  i was amazed   i loved every moment of it   we stopped off at a grocery store and i saw the novelization for the movie   i bought and and went home and started reading it   by the weekend i was done and on my way to being a super fan   over the next few months i consumed everything trek   rented every episode   rented the movies  bought the books   started to buy the movies and shows when i could afford it   made trek friends   

then we got news that there would be a new generation of characters and a new star trek on tv   my friends all proclaimed that trek was kirk  spock and mccoy and anything else was  not trek    

but we all know how that turned out   

since then i have seen every episode of trek  read the books and all the comics   i am still a super fan 

also my mom totally realized i had snuck out and didn t ground me  but let me know this was the one and only time she would tolerate it   

can i also say that my reading comprehension skills in school improved greatly becoming an avid reader   all my teachers were amazed at my improvement ",1644509145,startrek
