This is a natural language processing project. The aim of the project is to build and compare two classification models; logistic regression and random forest. 

The models are developed to accurately predict which subreddit a post belongs to.

For this project, I am using the [Star Trek](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/) and [Star Wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/) subreddit.

I used the  [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API to collect 1000 posts each from both subreddits.
